# Nmap (Network Mapper)

Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source network scanner used by network administrators and security professionals to discover devices and services on a network, assess network inventories, manage service upgrade schedules, and monitor host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, and what type of packet filters/[[firewalls]] are in use.

## Key Features

- **Host Discovery:** Identifies devices on the network, determining which hosts are available and the services they offer.
- **Port Scanning:** Enumerates open ports on target hosts.
- **Version Detection:** Helps in identifying the application name and version number of the services running on open ports.
- **OS Detection:** Determines the operating system and hardware characteristics of networked devices.
- **Scriptable Interaction:** Uses the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) for more advanced discovery and security auditing.

## How It Works

Nmap sends specially crafted packets to the target host and then analyzes the responses to discover hosts and services on a computer network. It supports several types of scans, most notably TCP SYN scans, which are used to determine if ports are open by sending a SYN packet and waiting for a response, and UDP scans for identifying open UDP ports.

## Advantages

- **Flexibility:** Offers a variety of options for scanning in different environments and for different purposes.
- **Wide Range of Features:** From basic network scanning to advanced vulnerability detection.
- **Extensive OS and Service Version Database:** Regularly updated to recognize the latest operating systems and network services.
- **Powerful Scripting Engine:** Allows users to write scripts for customized tasks.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Detectability:** Certain scans are easily detected by IDS/IPS, potentially alerting adversaries.
- **Misconfigurations:** Incorrectly configured scans can lead to incomplete or misleading results.

## Documentation and Resources

- **Official Nmap Website:** [Nmap Official Site](https://nmap.org/)
- **Official Nmap Documentation:** [Nmap Documentation](https://nmap.org/docs.html)
- **Nmap Network Scanning Book:** [Nmap Book](https://nmap.org/book/) by Gordon Lyon (also known as Fyodor Vaskovich), the creator of Nmap.

## Helpful Beginner Tips

- **Start with Simple Scans:** Begin by running simple scans, such as `nmap -sP 192.168.1.*` to discover which hosts are up in a local subnet.
- **Use the Zenmap GUI:** For beginners, using Nmapâ€™s official GUI, Zenmap, can simplify the scanning process and help in understanding the command options.
- **Practice Ethical Scanning:** Always have permission to scan networks. Unauthorized scanning can be considered illegal or intrusive.
- **Learn from Examples:** Explore the wide range of scan types and scripts included in the Nmap documentation and book to better understand how to effectively use the tool.

## Subtopics

 - **[[Banner Grabbing]]**: a technique used to gain information about a computer system on a network and the services running on its open ports.
 - **[[Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)]]**:
	 - **[[TCP Message Types]]**: are part of the TCP header used to manage the state of a TCP connection
- **[[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)]]**: 


## Scripts

NMAP uses the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) to extend its functionality with scripts that can perform a wide range of functions from vulnerability detection to advanced network discovery:
- **Default Scripts (-sC):** Executes standard scripts for additional discovery.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Scripts in NSE can check for vulnerabilities within the network.

## How To Use Nmap

### Basic Usage

To run a simple scan on a target, you can use the following command:
```bash
nmap [target]
```
Where `[target]` can be an IP address, a range of IP addresses, or a domain name.

### Common Scanning Techniques

1. **Ping Scan:** To check if a host is online without scanning ports:
   ```bash
   nmap -sn [target]
   ```

2. **Scan Specific Ports:** To scan specific ports, use the `-p` option:
   ```bash
   nmap -p 80,443 [target]
   ```

3. **Aggressive Scan:** An aggressive scan performs service detection, OS detection, traceroute, and runs scripts against target services:
   ```bash
   nmap -A [target]
   ```

4. **Stealth Scan:** Use a SYN scan to be less intrusive and avoid logging the scan as a full connection:
   ```bash
   nmap -sS [target]
   ```

5. **UDP Scan:** Scanning UDP ports can be done with the `-sU` option:
   ```bash
   nmap -sU [target]
   ```

6. **Full Scan:** To scan all 65535 ports, use:
   ```bash
   nmap -p- [target]
   ```

### Interpreting Results

- **Open:** The port is accessible and responding to requests.
- **Closed:** The port is accessible but no application is listening on it.
- **Filtered:** Nmap cannot determine if the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port.
- **Unfiltered:** The port is accessible, but Nmap cannot determine if it is open or closed.
- **Open|Filtered:** Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.

### Advanced Usage

- **OS Detection:** Use the `-O` option to attempt to determine the operating system of the target:
  ```bash
  nmap -O [target]
  ```

- **Service Version Detection:** To determine service versions running on open ports, use the `-sV` option:
  ```bash
  nmap -sV [target]
  ```

- **Script Scanning:** Nmap's scripting engine (NSE) is extremely powerful and can be used to perform a variety of network security checks:
  ```bash
  nmap --script=default [target]
  ```

- **Output Options:** Save your scan results in a specific format for later analysis:
  ```bash
  nmap -oX output.xml [target]  # XML format
  nmap -oN output.nmap [target] # Normal format
  ```
## Scan Types

| **Scan Type**          | **Description**                                                                                                                    | **Primary Function**                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Sweep Scan**         | Involves pinging a range of IP addresses to identify which hosts are online. Commonly uses ICMP Echo requests or ARP for LANs.      | Quickly identify active hosts within a network.   |
| **Trace Scan**         | Uses the `--traceroute` option in Nmap to identify the path packets take to reach a specific host.                                  | Map the route packets take through the network.   |
| **Port Scanning**      | The core function of Nmap, this scan type probes ports on a host to identify network services and their status (open, closed, etc.). | Determine open, closed, or filtered ports on a host. |
| **Fingerprinting**     | Also known as OS detection, uses a series of TCP/IP stack behavior tests to identify the operating system of a target host.         | Identify the operating system of networked devices. |
| **Version Scanning**   | Uses the `-sV` option to probe ports to determine service/application version information running on open ports.                   | Identify application and service versions to assess compatibility or vulnerabilities. |
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | While not a direct feature of Nmap, the NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) can be used to run scripts that check for known vulnerabilities. | Check for known vulnerabilities in services and protocols on the network. |
