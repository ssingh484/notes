# Banner Grabbing

Banner grabbing is a [[network security]] technique used to gather information about computer systems on a network and the services running on its open ports. This method involves sending requests to a system and analyzing the responses to identify details about operating systems, software versions, and active services, which can be crucial for both network management and [[vulnerability assessment]].

## How It Works

Banner grabbing can be performed using manual telnet sessions, automated scanning tools, or custom scripts that connect to network ports and retrieve service details exposed in the banner (a text block displayed during an initial connection). These banners often contain software version numbers, system information, and other details that are useful for further [[penetration testing]] or [[vulnerability assessment]].

## Key Features

- **Service Identification:** Quickly identifies what services are running on which ports.
- **Software Version Detection:** Captures specific versions of software, aiding in [[vulnerability identification]].
- **Automated Tools Support:** Commonly used with network scanning tools that automate the banner grabbing process.

## Advantages

- **Security Auditing:** Helps security professionals assess the security posture of their networks by identifying potentially outdated or vulnerable software.
- **Network Management:** Assists in managing network configurations by mapping out the services running on all parts of the network.
- **[[Vulnerability Assessment]]:** Critical in the initial stages of [[vulnerability assessment]] and [[penetration testing]] to tailor attacks or security measures to the specific software versions in use.

## Documentation and Resources

- **Telnet:** Simple manual method for banner grabbing, where users can connect directly to services to view the banner. [Using Telnet for Banner Grabbing](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/utelnet.htm)

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Establishes guidelines for information security management systems, under which regular network scanning and assessment, including banner grabbing, can fall as part of an organization's risk assessment and treatment process.
- **[[NIST Cybersecurity Framework|NIST Guidelines]]:** As part of regular vulnerability assessments, [[NIST Cybersecurity Framework|NIST guidelines]] may recommend using techniques like banner grabbing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance with security best practices.

## Helpful Beginner Tips

- **Start with Safe Targets:** Practice banner grabbing on your own network or on systems where you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning can lead to legal issues.
- **Use Automated Tools for Efficiency:** Tools like [[Nmap]] can automate the process and provide comprehensive insights that would be time-consuming to gather manually.
- **Interpret Responses Carefully:** Not all services display banners, and some may show misleading information as a defensive measure against unauthorized access.
- **Keep Tools Updated:** Ensure that the tools you use for banner grabbing are up-to-date to utilize the latest features and maintain compatibility with new systems and standards.

## Current Status

While banner grabbing remains a fundamental technique in cybersecurity for information gathering, it is also evolving with increasing use of more sophisticated and less detectable methods as systems become better at hiding or falsifying banner information to thwart unauthorized access.
