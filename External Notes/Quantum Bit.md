## Definition

A qubit, or quantum bit, is the fundamental unit of quantum information. It is the quantum analogue to a classical bit.

## Key Characteristics

- **[[Quantum Superposition|Superposition]]**: Unlike classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a [[Quantum Superposition|superposition]] of both states simultaneously. This property allows [[Quantum Computing|quantum computers]] to process a large amount of possibilities at once.
    
- **[[Quantum Entanglement|Entanglement]]**: When qubits become entangled, the state of one qubit becomes dependent on the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This is a key resource in [[quantum computing]] and quantum communication.
    
- **Measurement**: A qubit in [[Quantum Superposition|superposition]] does not give a definite outcome when measured. Instead, it collapses to one of its basis states (0 or 1) with a certain probability.
    

## Representing Qubits

- **Bloch Sphere**: A qubit's state can be visualized on the Bloch sphere, a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system.

## Physical Realizations

- **Trapped Ions**: Individual ions are trapped using electromagnetic fields and manipulated using lasers.
    
- **Superconducting Circuits**: These are tiny circuits made of certain materials that can carry an electric current without resistance.
    
- **Photonic Qubits**: Use individual photons, particles of light, to carry quantum information.
    
- **Topological Qubits**: Use anyons, particles that exist only in two dimensions, and their braiding for quantum computation.
    

## Applications

- **[[Quantum Computing]]**: Qubits are the building blocks of [[Quantum Computing|quantum computers]], which promise unprecedented computational power for certain problems.
    
- **Quantum Communication**: Qubits enable ultra-secure quantum communication protocols like [[quantum key distribution]] ([[Quantum Key Distribution|QKD]]).
    
- **Quantum Simulation**: Qubits can be used to simulate and understand complex quantum systems that are difficult for classical computers.
    

## Challenges

- **Decoherence**: Qubits are extremely sensitive to their environment, causing them to lose their quantum behavior.
    
- **Error Rates**: Current qubits are prone to errors. Error correction techniques are crucial for scalable [[quantum computing]].
