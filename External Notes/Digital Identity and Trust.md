# Digital Identity and Trust

Digital Identity and Trust refers to the technologies and processes that verify the identity of individuals or entities in digital environments and manage the level of trust associated with those identities. This concept is fundamental to enabling secure, reliable interactions in online and electronic transactions.

## How It Works

Digital identity systems typically involve the creation of digital profiles that represent users or entities across various platforms and services. Trust is established through methods that authenticate these identities and authorize them to perform certain actions, based on the verified information.

## Key Features

- **[[Authentication Protocols]]:** Include methods such as passwords, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to verify identities.
- **Authorization Mechanisms:** Determine what resources a user can access within a system after their identity is verified.
- **Identity Providers (IdPs):** Services that create, maintain, and manage identity information while providing authentication services to relying parties.
- **Federated Identity:** Allows users to port a single identity for authentication across multiple systems and organizations.

## Common Techniques

- **[[Single Sign-On]] ([[Single Sign-On|SSO]]):** Enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple related but independent software systems without re-authenticating.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity for a login or other transaction.
- **[[Public Key Infrastructure]] ([[Public Key Infrastructure|PKI]]):** Uses a pair of public and private cryptographic keys to secure electronic communications and facilitate secure identity verification.
- **Biometrics:** Uses unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to authenticate individuals.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Security:** Strong digital identity verification methods reduce the risk of unauthorized access and fraud.
- **Improved User Experience:** Systems like [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] simplify the user experience by reducing the need for multiple logins.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Automating identity verification processes leads to faster and more efficient user access and transaction approval.
- **Compliance Support:** Helps organizations meet regulatory requirements related to identity management and data security.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-63]],** "Digital Identity Guidelines": Provides detailed guidance on the enrollment and identity proofing of users, authenticator and verifier performance, and [[federation]] solutions.
- **EU eIDAS Regulation:** Establishes a framework for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market.
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]]):** Includes provisions that ensure the protection of personal data processed for digital identification.

## Best Practices

- Implement robust authentication measures, including MFA, to strengthen security.
- Use federated identity management to streamline access across platforms while maintaining security standards.
- Regularly review and update digital identity systems to incorporate advanced security technologies and respond to [[emerging threats]].
- Educate users about the importance of secure identity practices, such as safeguarding passwords and recognizing [[phishing]] attacks.

## Current Status

As the digital landscape evolves, so too does the field of digital identity and trust. New technologies, such as blockchain and AI, are being explored to enhance the security and efficiency of digital identity systems. Meanwhile, organizations continue to refine their strategies to balance user convenience with stringent security requirements.
