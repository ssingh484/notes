# NIST Special Publication 800-86

NIST Special Publication 800-86, titled "Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response," is a comprehensive document that provides guidelines for incorporating digital forensic methods into cybersecurity incident response. This publication is part of the broader suite of NIST standards aimed at improving the security of federal information systems and providing detailed guidance on managing cybersecurity incidents effectively.

## Key Features

- **Forensic Readiness:** Emphasizes the importance of preparing for forensic activities as part of an incident response plan.
- **Integration with Incident Response:** Details how forensic analysis can be seamlessly integrated into the incident response process to improve the effectiveness of detecting, understanding, and mitigating cyber attacks.
- **Best Practices for Evidence Collection:** Offers guidelines on how to collect, handle, and preserve digital evidence to maintain its integrity and admissibility in legal proceedings.
- **Tools and Techniques:** Suggests appropriate tools and techniques for forensic analysis that align with different types of security incidents.

## How It Works

The document outlines a structured approach to integrating forensic capabilities into incident response frameworks:

1. **Preparation:** Establishing policies and procedures for forensic analysis, including training for responders and securing forensic tools.
2. **Detection and Analysis:** Utilizing forensic techniques to identify and analyze indicators of compromise.
3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:** Applying forensic insights to contain and eradicate threats, followed by recovery of operations.
4. **Post-Incident Activity:** Using information gathered during forensic analysis to improve future security measures and responses.

## Common Techniques

- **Disk and Data Capture:** Techniques for securely capturing data and disk images without altering the original evidence.
- **Memory Forensics:** Analyzing volatile data in system memory to capture evidence that is not preserved after a power down.
- **Log Analysis:** Detailed examination of logs to trace and understand the actions of an attacker.
- **Network Forensics:** Capturing and analyzing network traffic to detect intrusion patterns and sources of attacks.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Incident Understanding:** Provides a deeper understanding of security incidents, enabling more effective mitigation strategies.
- **Improved Legal Compliance:** Ensures that digital evidence is handled in a manner compliant with legal standards.
- **Better Preparedness:** Prepares organizations to respond swiftly and effectively to incidents with a forensic-aware approach.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-53|NIST SP 800-53]]:** Provides a broader set of security controls, of which SP 800-86 is an integral part for handling incident responses.
- **ISO/IEC 27035:** International standard for incident management that complements the guidelines provided in SP 800-86.

## Best Practices

- Develop and maintain a forensic response capability that aligns with organizational incident response plans.
- Regularly update and test forensic tools and procedures to ensure they are effective against current threats.
- Train incident response teams on forensic best practices and legal considerations.

## Current Status

As cybersecurity threats evolve, so does the guidance in NIST SP 800-86. The publication is periodically reviewed and updated to include the latest forensic technologies, methods, and regulatory requirements.
