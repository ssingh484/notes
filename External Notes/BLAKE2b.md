## Overview

**BLAKE2b** is a [[cryptographic hash function]] that is faster than [[MD5]], [[SHA-1]], and [[SHA-2]], while being as secure as the latest standard [[SHA-3]]. It is an improved version of the original BLAKE [[hash function]], designed to provide high-speed hashing for modern processors.

## Key Features

1. **Performance**: [[BLAKE2]] often outperforms other widely accepted [[Hash Function|hash functions]] in terms of speed, especially for short messages.
    
2. **Security**: Designed with a high security margin; it's considered safe against known cryptanalytic attack techniques.
    
3. **Versatility**: [[BLAKE2]] comes in two main flavors: BLAKE2b (optimized for 64-bit platforms) and BLAKE2s (optimized for 8- to 32-bit platforms).
    
4. **Simple Design**: Its design is more straightforward than [[SHA-3]], making it easier to understand and analyze.
    
5. **No Patents**: [[BLAKE2]] is unencumbered by patents, ensuring it can be used freely in any application.
    

## Applications

- **Cryptographic Authentication**: Producing message digests to confirm the integrity and [[authenticity]] of a message.
    
- **Password Hashing**: Securely storing user passwords for authentication.
    
- **File Integrity Checking**: Ensuring files have not been tampered with during storage or transfer.
    

## Technical Details

- Based on the **HAIFA** construction (like its predecessor, BLAKE).
    
- Uses many of the same components as the ChaCha stream cipher, leading to efficiency and good diffusion.
    

## Comparisons

- **[[SHA-3]]**: [[BLAKE2]] was designed around the same time as the [[SHA-3]] competition, but it wasn't an entrant. Despite that, it offers similar levels of security while often being faster.
    
- **[[SHA-256]]**: While widely used, [[SHA-256]] is generally slower than BLAKE2b for the same level of security.
