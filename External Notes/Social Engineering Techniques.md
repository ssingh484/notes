# Social Engineering Techniques

Social engineering techniques involve the psychological manipulation of individuals to obtain confidential information, access, or cooperation in activities that compromise security. These methods are employed by attackers to exploit human vulnerabilities rather than technical vulnerabilities in systems.

## How It Works

Social engineering typically involves gaining the victim's trust by posing as a legitimate entity or authority figure and then manipulating the individual into divulging sensitive information, performing actions that break security protocols, or granting access to restricted areas. This is often achieved through direct interaction, whether in person, via email, phone, or other communication channels.

## Key Features

- **[[Pretexting]]:** Creating a fabricated scenario or pretext to engage the target and extract information or incite action, usually after [[building rapport]].
- **[[Phishing]]:** Sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from reputable sources to steal sensitive data like login credentials and credit card numbers.
- **[[Spear Phishing]]:** A more targeted form of [[phishing]] that involves sending personalized messages to specific individuals for a higher success rate.
- **[[Baiting]]:** Offering something enticing to the victim in exchange for information or access.
- **[[Tailgating]]:** Physically following authorized personnel into restricted areas without proper credentials.
- **[[Quid Pro Quo]]:** Offering a beneficial service or aid in exchange for information or access.

## Problem Addressed

Social engineering addresses the exploitation of the weakest link in security systems—humans. By manipulating individuals, attackers can bypass advanced technical security measures and gain access to secured systems.

## Implications

The success of social engineering attacks can lead to significant data breaches, financial losses, and damage to personal and organizational reputations. These attacks exploit human psychology, making them difficult to detect and prevent without proper [[awareness and training]].

## Impact

Social engineering compromises the integrity and confidentiality of information systems, leading to unauthorized access and potential financial and strategic damage. It undermines trust within organizations and can lead to severe reputational harm.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Education and Awareness Training:** Regular training sessions for employees to recognize and respond to social engineering tactics.
- **Verification Procedures:** Implementing strict verification processes to confirm identities before sensitive information is disclosed or access is granted.
- **Security Policies:** Establishing and enforcing policies that limit information sharing and require multi-factor authentication.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Social engineering exploits human error and psychological vulnerabilities such as the desire to be helpful, fear of authority, or greed. These human factors make social engineering a persistent threat despite advancements in technical security measures.

Social engineering techniques exploit human vulnerabilities rather than technological flaws to gain unauthorized access to information or systems. 

Here are some of the most common techniques adversaries utilize:

1. **[[Phishing]]**: This involves sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source, typically via email, with the aim of stealing sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information.
    
2. **[[Spear Phishing]]**: A more targeted version of [[phishing]] where the attacker has done research on their victim to personalize the message, making the fraudulent communication seem more legitimate and increasing the chances of success.
    
3. **[[Pretexting]]**: The attacker fabricates a scenario or invents a pretext to engage a targeted victim in a manner that increases the likelihood of divulging information. This often involves impersonating coworkers, police, bank officials, or other persons who have right-to-know authority.
    
4. **[[Baiting]]**: Similar to [[phishing]], [[baiting]] involves offering something enticing to the victim in exchange for private information. This could be in the form of a physical device, like a USB drive labeled “confidential,” left in a place where it can be easily found and plugged into a computer, initiating [[malware]].
    
5. **[[Quid Pro Quo]]**: A variation of [[baiting]], where the attacker requests personal information in exchange for some compensation. For example, posing as a researcher and offering a free gift in return for answering a survey.
    
6. **[[Tailgating]]**: An attacker seeking entry to a restricted area secures it without the necessary authentication by following an authorized person in. Often the attacker simply asks the employee to hold the door, not arousing any suspicion.
    
7. **[[Social Media Scams]]**: Attackers use social media platforms to track and collect information about a potential victim. This information can be used to craft highly effective [[spear phishing]] attacks.
    
8. **[[Vishing (Voice Phishing)]]**: The attacker uses the telephone system to trick the victim into divulging sensitive information, often pretending to call from a bank, the police, or a trusted company.
    
9. **[[Smishing (SMS Phishing)]]**: The use of text messages to lure victims into revealing personal information, downloading [[malware]], or visiting a malicious website.
    
10. **[[Diversion Theft]]**: This involves tricking the courier or postal service into delivering something to a wrong address as part of a broader fraud scheme.
    

Each of these techniques exploits trust and manipulates human emotions like curiosity, fear, or the desire to be helpful, making them effective against unwary individuals. [[Awareness and training]] are key defenses against these types of attacks.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Security Awareness Training Platforms:** Tools like KnowBe4 or Proofpoint provide simulated [[phishing]] attacks and training modules to educate employees about social engineering.
- **Communication Security Solutions:** Secure email gateways and communication platforms that filter [[phishing]] attempts and unauthorized access requests.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-50]],** "Building an Information Technology Security [[Awareness and Training]] Program": Provides guidelines for developing comprehensive security training programs that include awareness of social engineering threats.
- **[[ISOIEC 27002|ISO/IEC 27002]]:** Offers best practice recommendations on information security management, including human resources security and awareness training to combat social engineering.

## Best Practices

- Conduct regular security awareness training that includes the identification of social engineering tactics.
- Develop and enforce policies that require employee verification processes for sensitive operations.
- Encourage a security-minded culture where employees feel comfortable questioning suspicious requests.

## Current Status

As technology evolves and becomes more secure, social engineering remains a constant threat due to its reliance on human vulnerabilities. Ongoing efforts to educate and implement robust verification processes are vital to mitigating this threat.
