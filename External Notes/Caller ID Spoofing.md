# Caller ID Spoofing

## Definition

Caller ID spoofing is a technique where attackers manipulate the caller ID information to make it appear as though the call is coming from a trusted or known number. This is often used in [[Social Engineering Techniques|social engineering]] attacks to gain trust and deceive the target into divulging sensitive information or performing specific actions.

## Key Features

- **Caller ID Manipulation:** Alters the phone number displayed on the recipient's caller ID.
- **Ease of Access:** Spoofing apps and services are widely available and inexpensive.
- **Human Trust Exploitation:** Leverages the recipient’s trust in known or official numbers.
- **Limited Verification:** Often bypasses verification processes that rely on phone numbers.

## Problem Addressed

Caller ID spoofing is a tool for social engineers to bypass security measures and exploit the trust associated with familiar phone numbers. It is particularly effective in [[phishing]] attacks, financial fraud, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Implications

- **Security Breach:** Compromises the integrity of phone-based authentication and verification processes.
- **Privacy Violation:** Enables attackers to impersonate trusted entities, leading to unauthorized access to personal and sensitive data.
- **Financial Fraud:** Facilitates fraudulent activities such as bank account takeovers and unauthorized transactions.

## Impact

- **Trust Erosion:** Decreases trust in phone-based communications and verification methods.
- **Financial Loss:** Can result in significant financial losses for individuals and organizations.
- **Increased Security Measures:** Necessitates the implementation of additional security protocols to mitigate spoofing risks.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Callback Verification:** Implementing callback systems to verify the caller’s identity.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Using 2FA methods that do not rely solely on phone numbers.
- **Service Codes and PINs:** Adding service codes, PINs, and verbal passcodes for identity verification.
- **Advanced Caller ID:** Using advanced caller ID verification technologies to detect and block spoofed calls.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Lack of Unified Telecom Standards:** Variations in telecom security standards make it difficult to implement uniform spoofing prevention measures.
- **Dependence on Caller ID:** Overreliance on caller ID for verification without additional layers of security.
- **Inadequate Verification Processes:** Insufficient verification methods that do not cross-check the authenticity of the caller’s identity.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Spoofing Apps:** Applications available on app stores that allow users to spoof caller IDs.
- **Voice Cloning Tools:** Software that can mimic a person’s voice, making spoofing even more convincing.
- **[[OSINT]] Tools:** [[OSINT|Open-source intelligence]] tools to gather information about targets to make spoofing more effective.

## Current Status

Caller ID spoofing remains a prevalent threat due to the lack of comprehensive anti-spoofing measures in telecom systems. While some progress has been made in implementing standards like STIR/SHAKEN in the United States, global adoption and enforcement are inconsistent.

## Revision History

- **2024-06-02:** Date added.
