# ISO/IEC 14888-3

ISO/IEC 14888-3 is part of the international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), specifically focusing on [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]] based on [[Asymmetric Encryption|asymmetric cryptography]]. This segment of the standard outlines methods for [[digital signature]] generation and verification, which do not rely on message recovery.

## Key Features

- **[[Asymmetric Encryption|Asymmetric Cryptography]]:** Utilizes public and private key pairs to secure [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]].
- **Non-repudiation:** Ensures that once a document is signed, the signer cannot deny having signed it.
- **Integrity:** Verifies that the data has not been altered in transit.
- **Authentication:** Confirms the identity of the signatory.

## How It Works

- **Signature Generation:** The sender uses their [[private key]] to create a [[digital signature]] on a message or document.
- **Signature Verification:** The receiver uses the sender's public key to verify the authenticity of the digital signature.

## Advantages

- **Security:** Provides a high level of security for transactions, ensuring that signatures are verifiable and legally binding.
- **Flexibility:** Supports various cryptographic techniques and [[Algorithm|algorithms]], providing flexibility in implementation according to organizational needs.
- **Interoperability:** Facilitates secure communication and document exchange across different systems and international borders.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Establishes guidelines and general principles for initiating, implementing, maintaining, and improving information security management in an organization, supporting the secure implementation of [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]].
- **eIDAS Regulation (EU):** Establishes standards for electronic identification and trust services, including [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]], ensuring they are legally recognized across EU countries.

## Major Tools/Software

- **Digital Signature Software:** Tools like Adobe Sign and DocuSign that facilitate the creation and verification of [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]] according to ISO/IEC 14888-3.
- **Cryptographic Libraries:** Software libraries such as OpenSSL and Bouncy Castle that provide developers with the cryptographic tools necessary to implement [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]] based on ISO/IEC 14888-3 standards.

## Best Practices

- **Secure Key Management:** Ensuring that private keys used for signature generation are stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Regular Audits:** Conducting regular security audits of [[digital signature]] systems to ensure compliance with ISO/IEC 14888-3 and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **User Training:** Educating users on the importance of [[digital signature]] security and best practices for its use.

## Current Status

The standard continues to evolve in response to new technological developments and security challenges in the field of digital [[cryptography]]. As digital transactions become increasingly commonplace, the relevance of ISO/IEC 14888-3 is expected to grow, influencing various sectors including legal, financial, and governmental.
