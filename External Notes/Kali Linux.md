# Kali Linux

Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and [[penetration testing]]. It is developed, funded, and maintained by Offensive Security, a leading information security training company.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Toolset:** Includes over 600 pre-installed [[penetration testing]] programs, including [[Nmap]] (a network mapper), [[Wireshark]] (a packet analyzer), [[John the Ripper]] (a password cracker), and [[Aircrack-ng]] (a software suite for penetration-testing wireless LANs).
- **Live Boot Capability:** Can be run from a USB stick or DVD without needing installation, which is ideal for forensic purposes where no traces are to be left.
- **Custom Kernel:** Tailored specifically for [[penetration testing]], with patches that allow for injection of packets in wireless networks and other specific tasks.
- **Regular Updates:** Maintained with regular updates to tools and distributions, ensuring the latest software patches and improvements are available.
