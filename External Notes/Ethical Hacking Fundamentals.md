# Ethical Hacking Fundamentals

Ethical Hacking Fundamentals involve the practices and principles used by cybersecurity professionals, known as ethical hackers, to systematically penetrate networks, applications, and other digital environments. This is done with the aim of identifying vulnerabilities and security gaps that malicious hackers could exploit, but with the authorization and for the benefit of the organization owning the systems.

## Key Features

- **Legal Framework**: Conducted within legal boundaries with explicit permission from the system owners.
- **Security Assessment**: Identifying and testing system vulnerabilities without malicious intent.
- **Tools and Techniques**: Utilizing a variety of tools and methods similar to those used by malicious hackers.
- **Reporting and Remediation**: Documenting findings and providing recommendations for strengthening security.

## Types of Hacking 

1. [[Network Hacking]]
	1. Pre-Connection Network Attacks
	2. Gaining Access
	3. Post-Connection Attacks

## Problem Addressed

Ethical hacking addresses the need for advanced defensive strategies to protect against cyber threats. By identifying vulnerabilities from an attacker’s perspective, organizations can proactively secure their systems against potential breaches.

## Implications

Ethical hacking is pivotal for enhancing organizational security protocols, ensuring that vulnerabilities are not only discovered but also rectified before they can be exploited by adversaries.

## Impact

- **Direct Effects**: Immediate improvement in system security through the identification and patching of vulnerabilities.
- **Long-Term Influence**: Continual enhancement of cybersecurity defenses and practices, fostering a culture of security and resilience.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **[[Penetration Testing]]**: Systematic testing of systems to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
- **[[Red Teaming]]**: Conducting broad scope attacks on an organization to test its response capabilities.
- **Security Audits**: Regular reviews of security policies and procedures to ensure they are effective and up-to-date.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Limited Scope**: [[Ethical hacking]] might not uncover all potential vulnerabilities due to its scope defined by the client’s requirements.
- **Resource Intensity**: Requires significant time, expertise, and resources to conduct thoroughly and effectively.

## Common Tools/Software

- **[[Metasploit]]**: A tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine.
- **Burp Suite**: An integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications.
- **[[Nmap]]**: A network mapping tool used to discover devices and services on a computer network.
- [[Kali Linux]]: An operating system specifically for ethical hacking. 

## Current Status

The practice of [[ethical hacking]] is increasingly recognized as essential in the cybersecurity landscape, with more organizations investing in regular [[ethical hacking]] initiatives to bolster their security posture.

## List of Ethical Hacking Fundamentals

1. **[[Cyber-attack Chain]]**: Use this for identifying the 'kill list'. 
2. **Gaining Authorized Access**: Always operate with explicit permission.
3. **Scoping and Planning**: Define the scope and goals of a penetration test.
4. **[[Vulnerability Identification]]**: Use tools and techniques to identify security weaknesses.
5. **Exploitation**: Safely exploiting vulnerabilities to determine their impact.
6. **Reporting**: Document findings and suggest remedial actions.
7. **Remediation Follow-Up**: Assist in remedying vulnerabilities and retesting to ensure they are secure.
