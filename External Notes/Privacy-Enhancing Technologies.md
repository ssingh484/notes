# Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are tools and methods designed to help individuals and organizations protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. PETs aim to enhance user privacy by minimizing personal data usage, maximizing data security, and empowering users to control their own information.

## How It Works

PETs employ a variety of techniques to protect privacy:

- **Data Minimization:** Reducing the collection and use of personal data to the minimum necessary.
- **[[Encryption]]:** Encrypting data to ensure that it is only accessible to those with authorization.
- **Anonymization and Pseudonymization:** Removing or masking personal identifiers from data sets to prevent linkage to identities.
- **Secure Multiparty Computation:** Allowing parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.
- **Differential Privacy:** Introducing randomness into datasets to prevent the identification of individuals in aggregated data.
- **Federated Learning:** Training machine learning models across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them.

## Common Techniques

- **[[Zero-Knowledge Proofs]]:** Allowing one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.
- **Private Browsing Modes:** Web browsers prevent browsing history, cookies, and site data from being saved.
- **[[Virtual Private Networks|VPN]] Services:** Creating a secure and encrypted connection to another network over the Internet, masking the userâ€™s IP address.
- **Onion Routing ([[Tor Network|Tor]]):** Directing Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network consisting of more than seven thousand relays to conceal a user's location and usage.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Security:** Protects sensitive data from cyber threats and unauthorized access.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Helps organizations comply with privacy regulations such as [[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)|HIPAA]], and others.
- **Trust Building:** Increases user confidence by demonstrating commitment to privacy.
- **Reduced Data Breach Risk:** Limits the potential impact of data breaches by minimizing the amount of data collected and maintaining the anonymity of stored information.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]]):** Encourages the use of PETs as part of its privacy by design and by default requirements, aiming to enhance data protection and security from the onset of systems and processes.
- **[[California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)|California Consumer Privacy Act]] ([[California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)|CCPA]]):** Similar to [[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]], it provides consumers with rights over their personal information, supporting technologies that promote these rights.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** While focused on information security management, this standard supports implementing PETs as part of an organization's risk management process.

## Current Status

The adoption of PETs is growing as awareness of privacy concerns increases and as regulatory pressures intensify. Advances in technology are continuously improving the effectiveness and accessibility of PETs, making them an integral part of modern privacy and security strategies.
