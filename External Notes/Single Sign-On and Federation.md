# Single Sign-On and Federation

[[Single Sign-On]] ([[Single Sign-On|SSO]]) and [[Federation]] are authentication processes that simplify user access across multiple independent systems or organizations. [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] allows a user to log in with a single set of credentials to access multiple applications, while [[Federation]] extends this capability across different organizational boundaries, enabling secure sharing of identities and authentication procedures.

## Key Features

- **[[Single Sign-On|SSO]]:**
    
    - **Single Credentials:** Users need only one set of credentials to access multiple services or applications.
    - **Centralized Authentication:** Streamlines the login process and reduces the need for multiple passwords.
- **[[Federation]]:**
    
    - **Identity Sharing:** Allows identity information to be shared across multiple trusted domains or organizations.
    - **Standards-Based:** Commonly uses standards such as SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), OpenID Connect, and OAuth to facilitate secure exchanges of authentication and authorization data.

## How It Works

- **[[Single Sign-On|SSO]]:**
    
    - A user logs in once with their credentials.
    - The [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] system authenticates the user and issues a token.
    - This token is then used to gain access to other applications without needing to log in again for each.
- **[[Federation]]:**
    
    - A user logs into their home domain.
    - When accessing services from another domain, the [[federation]] system uses tokens (often SAML assertions) to assert the user’s identity to the other domain.
    - The trusting domain verifies the assertion and grants access based on the shared trust agreement.

## Differences Between SSO and Federation

- **Scope:** [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] typically operates within a single organization or closely related entities, whereas [[Federation]] is designed to operate across different organizations.
- **Trust Relationships:** [[Federation]] requires agreements between different organizations to trust each other’s authentication assertions, which is not a requirement within a single organization’s [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] system.
- **Technological Implementation:** [[Federation]] often involves more complex integrations using standards like SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect, whereas [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] might use simpler or proprietary mechanisms.

## Problem Addressed

Both [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] and [[Federation]] address the complexity and security issues associated with managing multiple authentication credentials across various systems and platforms. They enhance user convenience and reduce the risk of password fatigue, which can lead to weak security practices.

## Implications

Implementing [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] and [[Federation]] can significantly improve user experience and IT efficiency. They also pose challenges in terms of maintaining security across trust boundaries and ensuring robust data privacy protections.

## Impact

[[Single Sign-On|SSO]] and [[Federation]] simplify access management, reduce IT overhead for password resets, and enhance security by minimizing the number of passwords users must remember. They are crucial in environments with extensive cross-organization interactions and cloud computing dependencies.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Robust [[Authentication Protocols]]:** Employ strong authentication methods, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), to enhance security.
- **Regular Audits:** Perform regular security audits and compliance checks to ensure that the systems adhere to security standards and policies.
- **[[Encryption]]:** Use [[encryption]] to protect identity data and authentication tokens transmitted across networks.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-63B]],** "Digital Identity Guidelines": Provides detailed guidance on the digital authentication of users, applicable to [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] and [[Federation]].
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Offers a framework for information security management, relevant for managing the security risks of [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] and [[Federation]] systems.
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] and other privacy laws:** Ensure that [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] and [[Federation]] practices comply with data protection and privacy regulations, particularly regarding cross-border data transfers and access management.

## Best Practices

- Implement and enforce strong authentication measures, such as MFA, especially for access to sensitive or critical resources.
- Ensure transparent user consent and data protection practices, especially in [[federation]] scenarios.
- Keep all [[identity and access management]] systems up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.

## Current Status

As enterprises increasingly adopt cloud services and collaborate across organizational boundaries, the importance of [[Single Sign-On|SSO]] and [[Federation]] continues to grow. Ongoing advancements in [[identity and access management]] technologies are enhancing the capabilities and security of these systems.
