# Key Encapsulation

Key Encapsulation is a method used in [[cryptography]] to securely transfer [[encryption]] keys between parties. It involves encapsulating a secret key within an encrypted message, using the recipient's [[public key]], so that only the recipient can decrypt the message to extract the secret key.

## How It Works

1. **Key Generation:** The sender generates a temporary, random [[encryption]] key intended for encrypting the actual data (plaintext).
2. **Encapsulation:** This key is then encapsulated (encrypted) using the recipient's [[public key]].
3. **Transmission:** The encapsulated key, along with the encrypted data, is sent to the recipient.
4. **Decapsulation:** Upon receiving, the recipient uses their [[private key]] to decapsulate (decrypt) the encapsulated key.
5. **Usage:** The recipient then uses the decrypted key to decrypt the data (ciphertext).

## Advantages

- **Security:** Since the key is encrypted, it is secure from interception during transmission.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces the complexity and size of data [[encryption]] by allowing bulk data to be encrypted with a symmetric key, which is then securely transmitted via key encapsulation.
- **Flexibility:** Can be integrated with various [[encryption]] schemes and supports hybrid approaches combining the efficiency of [[Symmetric Cryptography|symmetric encryption]] with the security of [[asymmetric encryption]].

## Major Tools

- **Libsodium:** Provides a platform for implementing modern, easy-to-use software libraries for [[encryption]], decryption, signatures, password hashing, and more.
- **RSA BSAFE:** A suite of [[FIPS 140-2]] validated cryptographic libraries that support key encapsulation among other cryptographic functions.
- **OpenSSL:** A robust, commercial-grade, full-featured toolkit for general-purpose [[cryptography]] and secure communication, supports key encapsulation mechanisms.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the public/[[private key]] pairs used for encapsulation/decapsulation are managed securely and replaced periodically.
- Use proven cryptographic libraries and tools that adhere to current standards and have been audited for security vulnerabilities.
- Combine key encapsulation with robust end-to-end [[encryption]] methods to secure both the transmission of the key and the data.

## Current Status

Key encapsulation remains a critical component of secure cryptographic implementations, especially important in scenarios involving secure key exchange over untrusted networks. Advances in [[quantum computing]] have started prompting research into [[quantum-resistant]] key encapsulation methods.
