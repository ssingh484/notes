# Security Principles

Security Principles form the foundational guidelines and practices that govern the protection of information systems. These principles are crucial for maintaining the security and functionality of IT infrastructures. A core component of these principles is the CIA Triadâ€”Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, which are essential for safeguarding information from unauthorized access and ensuring its reliability and accessibility.

## Key Features

- **[[Confidentiality]]**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **[[Integrity]]**: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.
- **[[Availability]]**: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.
- **[[Authentication and Authorization]]**: Verifying the identity of users and controlling their access to resources.
- **[[Non-repudiation]]**: Ensuring that a party in a transaction cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or a message that they originated.

## Major Security Principles

Here's a list of major security principles that are fundamental in the field of cybersecurity and information security:

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.
2. **Integrity**: Maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.
3. **Availability**: Ensuring that information is accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized entity, meaning that systems, functions, and data must be available to users when needed.
4. **Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, typically as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an IT system.
5. **Authorization**: The process of granting or denying a user, program, or process the right to access resources in an information system. This is distinct from authentication.
6. **Accountability**: The principle that ensures that the actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to that entity. This supports non-repudiation, deterrence, fault isolation, intrusion detection, and prevention, and after-action recovery and legal action.
7. **Non-repudiation**: The assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of their signature on a document or a message that they originated. This is critical in many legal and financial applications.
8. **Least Privilege**: The principle of providing the minimal level of access necessary for users to perform their job functions. This limits the potential damage that can be done if an account is misused or compromised.
9. **Separation of Duties**: Dividing critical functions among multiple people to prevent fraud or error. This means no single individual should have control over all critical functions of a transaction or process.
10. **Defense in Depth**: The use of multiple layers of security controls (defensive mechanisms) to protect the information and operations of an organization. If one layer fails, another steps up immediately to thwart an attack.
11. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: The design principle that in case of failure, the system defaults to a safe or no-access mode, as opposed to a fail-open scenario which can be exploitative.
12. **Security Through Obscurity**: While often critiqued, this principle involves keeping system details (like design and implementation) secret to minimize the risk of attack. However, this should not be the sole method of security.
13. **Time-based Security**: Emphasizing that security strength can degrade over time, and ensuring systems are capable of resisting attacks within a given time frame known as the exposure factor.
14. **Privacy by Design**: Integrating privacy and data protection from the onset of system designing, rather than an addition later on.

## Problem Addressed

Security Principles address the challenge of protecting digital and non-digital information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording, or destruction. They provide a structured framework to ensure the security of information systems across various industries.

## Implications

Implementing these principles is fundamental to achieving secure operations and protecting organizational assets. They support regulatory compliance efforts and help in building trust with customers and stakeholders by ensuring data is handled securely.

## Impact

- **Direct Effects**: Enhanced protection of sensitive information, reduced risk of data breaches, and improved user confidence in information systems.
- **Long-Term Influence**: Supports the creation of robust security cultures within organizations and the development of more secure systems and technologies.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **[[Encryption]]**: Protects confidentiality and integrity through data [[encryption]] in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control Systems**: Implements policies and controls to ensure availability and restrict unauthorized access.
- **Data Backup and Recovery**: Ensures availability by maintaining copies of critical data and systems that can be restored in case of a disaster.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Insider Threats**: Employees with access to sensitive information can accidentally or maliciously compromise security principles.
- **Outdated Systems**: Older systems may lack the capabilities to enforce modern security standards, leading to vulnerabilities.

## Common Tools/Software

- **SSL/TLS Protocols**: Protect the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.
- **[[Identity and Access Management]] ([[Identity and Access Management|IAM]]) Systems**: Manage user identities and control access to resources within an organization.
- **Backup Software**: Tools like Veeam and Acronis that ensure data is regularly backed up and can be restored quickly.

## Current Status

As cyber threats evolve, the importance of robust Security Principles continues to grow. Organizations are increasingly prioritizing the enhancement of their security frameworks to include advanced technologies and methodologies that adhere to these principles.
