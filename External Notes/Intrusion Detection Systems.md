# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are devices or software applications that monitor network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. Once identified, any suspicious activity is typically reported to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management (SIEM) system.

## Key Features

- **Signature-Based Detection:** Utilizes known patterns of misbehavior to identify malicious activity.
- **Anomaly-Based Detection:** Compares against an established baseline of normal activity to detect deviations that may signify an intrusion.
- **Network-Based IDS (NIDS):** Monitors network traffic for particular network segments or devices.
- **Host-Based IDS (HIDS):** Monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that host.

## Problem Addressed

IDSs are essential for identifying ongoing or potential incidents, including but not limited to intrusions by outsiders, misuse by insiders, and system malfunctions. These tools are vital for timely detection of security breaches and initiating appropriate security measures.

## Implications

The deployment of IDS in network architecture acts as a critical monitoring tool, allowing for the detection of threats in real time and providing a layer of security that complements traditional defenses like [[firewalls]] and antivirus.

## Impact

An IDS significantly enhances [[network security]] by providing alerts early in the attack process, allowing for immediate response before attackers can achieve their objectives. This is crucial in minimizing damage and maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Real-time Analysis and Reporting:** Provides up-to-date information about potential threats.
- **Integration with Other Security Measures:** Often integrated with [[firewalls]], encryption, and security management processes to enhance overall [[network security]].

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

IDS can suffer from a high number of false positives and false negatives, particularly in highly dynamic network environments. They can also be bypassed by sophisticated multi-stage attacks that do not trigger known patterns or anomalies.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Software Solutions:** Snort, Suricata, Bro (Zeek).
- **Appliance-Based Solutions:** Cisco Secure IDS, IBM Security Network Intrusion Detection System.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST SP 800-94, "Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)":** Provides guidance on IDPS types, uses, and configurations.
- **NIST SP 800-53, "Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations":** Includes controls for information system monitoring that integrate IDS technologies.
- **ANSSI Security Recommendations for Networks:** Outlines best practices for implementing IDS within [[network security]] frameworks.

## Best Practices

- Regularly update the IDS with new signatures and anomaly detection algorithms.
- Conduct frequent audits of IDS settings and performance to ensure they are tuned to the current network environment.
- Use comprehensive logging and alerting mechanisms to ensure that all relevant data is captured and reviewed.

## Current Status

IDS technology continues to evolve, incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques to improve detection rates and reduce false positives. There is also a growing trend of integrating IDS with other security tools to form a unified security posture.
