# Picnic

Picnic is a [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)|post-quantum cryptographic algorithm]] designed to be secure against attacks from both classical and [[Quantum Computing|quantum computers]]. It is primarily used for [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]], ensuring data integrity and authentication in a [[quantum computing]] era. Picnic is part of a group of [[Algorithm|algorithms]] submitted for consideration in the [[NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization]] project.

## How It Works

Picnic utilizes a [[zero-knowledge]] proof system in a non-interactive format, allowing one party to prove the possession of certain information, such as a secret key, without revealing the information itself. This method is combined with symmetric cryptographic techniques and [[Hash Function|hash functions]] to create a [[digital signature]] scheme that remains secure against quantum attacks.

### Key Steps:

1. **Key Generation:** Generates a pair of public and private keys using secure cryptographic functions.
2. **Signing Process:** Uses the [[private key]] and a set of cryptographic operations, including [[Hash Function|hash functions]] and symmetric keys, to generate a signature based on the data being signed.
3. **Verification Process:** Allows any party with the [[public key]] to verify the signature without needing access to the [[private key]].

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization]]:** As part of this initiative, Picnic is being evaluated for its security against [[Quantum Computing|quantum computers]]. This standardization process is crucial for developing secure [[cryptographic protocols]] in the post-quantum era.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** While not specific to Picnic, this standard requires the management of information risks, which can be mitigated by implementing [[quantum-resistant]] cryptographic solutions like Picnic.

## Advantages

- **[[Quantum-Resistant|Quantum Resistance]]:** Designed to offer security in a post-quantum world, making it resilient against both current and future cryptographic threats.
- **Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof:** Enhances security by ensuring that no reusable information is disclosed during the authentication process, thereby preventing potential replay attacks.
- **High Security:** Offers a high level of security for [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]], comparable to or exceeding current classical [[Algorithm|algorithms]] like [[External Notes/RSA]] and [[Elliptic Curve Cryptography|ECC]] in a quantum context.

## Major Tools

- **Microsoft Q# and Quantum Development Kit:** While not specific to Picnic, these tools help in simulating and developing [[quantum-resistant]] algorithms, providing a platform for testing [[cryptographic protocols]] against quantum attacks.
- **Open Quantum Safe (liboqs):** An open-source project that aims to support the development and prototyping of quantum-safe [[cryptography]]. Picnic is included in the library, allowing for integration and testing in various applications.

## Current Status

Picnic is currently under consideration and testing as part of the third round of the [[NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization]] project. It continues to be evaluated for its security and practicality in various applications.
