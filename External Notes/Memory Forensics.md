# Memory Forensics

Memory forensics is the science of analyzing computer memory (RAM) to investigate and identify incidents related to cybersecurity, such as [[malware]] infections, user actions, and system usage. It involves the capture and analysis of volatile data that exists in a computer's memory, which is not preserved when the machine is turned off.

## How It Works

Memory forensics typically begins with the acquisition of a memory imageâ€”a snapshot of what was in the system's RAM at the time of collection. This image is then analyzed using various tools and techniques to uncover evidence of malicious activities or system processes that are not visible in hard drive data analysis alone.

## Key Features

- **Volatile Data Analysis:** Focuses on data that exists temporarily in the system's RAM and is lost when the power is turned off.
- **Real-Time Evidence:** Captures the state of running programs and processes at a specific moment, providing insights into the actions and state of the system that are not recorded elsewhere.

## Common Techniques

- **Raw Memory Capture:** Using tools to dump the contents of physical memory to a file without any modification or filtering.
- **Process Analysis:** Identifying and examining running processes and their memory contents, which can reveal code injection, hooking, or other malicious modifications.
- **String Searching:** Scanning memory dumps for specific patterns or keywords that can indicate malicious activity or reveal sensitive information.
- **Heap Analysis:** Examining dynamic memory allocation within applications to find evidence of exploitation, such as heap sprays or use-after-free vulnerabilities.

## Advantages

- **Detection of Evasive Malware:** Capable of identifying [[malware]] that resides only in memory and avoids detection by traditional disk-based forensics.
- **Recovery of Decrypted Data:** Can recover data that is decrypted by applications in memory, providing access to information that is not available in encrypted form on disk.
- **Insight into Real-Time Operations:** Offers a snapshot of what was happening on a system at the time of the memory dump, including information about user actions, network connections, and more.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-86]],** "Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response": Recommends the use of memory forensics in the broader context of digital forensic and incident response (DFIR) activities.
- **[[ISOIEC 27037|ISO/IEC 27037]],** "Guidelines for Identification, Collection, Acquisition, and Preservation of Digital Evidence": Outlines best practices that include considerations for the volatile digital evidence found in system memory.

## Best Practices

- **Use Trusted Tools:** Employ reliable and tested tools for memory capture and analysis to ensure the integrity of the data.
- **Secure Handling of Memory Images:** Treat memory dumps as sensitive information; store and handle them securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Timely Analysis:** Perform memory captures as soon as possible in an investigation to minimize data loss due to system reboots or ongoing activities.
- **Continuous Training:** Stay updated with the latest techniques and tools in memory forensics to effectively respond to new and evolving threats.

## Current Status

Memory forensics is an evolving field with ongoing developments in tools and techniques to keep pace with the increasing sophistication of cyber threats. Researchers and practitioners continually refine methods to more effectively analyze and interpret memory data.
