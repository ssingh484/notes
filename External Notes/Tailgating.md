# Tailgating

Tailgating, also known as "piggybacking," is a physical security breach technique where an unauthorized person gains access to a restricted area by following closely behind an authorized person. The attacker exploits the trust and courtesy of individuals who hold open doors for others, bypassing security controls.

## Key Features

- **Physical Access:** Involves gaining physical entry to secure areas.
- **Exploitation of Trust:** Relies on the courtesy and trust of authorized individuals.
- **Simple Execution:** Requires minimal technical skills; relies primarily on [[Social Engineering Techniques|social engineering]].
- **Immediate Impact:** Provides direct access to secure areas, potentially compromising sensitive information or assets.

## Problem Addressed

Tailgating addresses the challenge of gaining physical access to restricted areas by exploiting human behavior and social norms. It bypasses physical security measures such as keycard systems, biometric scanners, and security personnel.

## Implications

- **Security Breach:** Unauthorized access to secure areas can lead to data theft, vandalism, or espionage.
- **Asset Theft:** Can result in the theft of physical or intellectual property.
- **Safety Risks:** Poses safety risks to employees if the intruder has malicious intent.
- **Operational Disruption:** May disrupt business operations and cause financial and reputational damage.

## Impact

- **Loss of Trust:** Erodes trust in physical security measures and employee vigilance.
- **Financial and Data Loss:** Can cause substantial financial losses and data breaches.
- **Reputation Damage:** Organizations may suffer reputational damage if tailgating leads to publicized security failures.
- **Regulatory Consequences:** Potential legal and regulatory repercussions for failing to protect against unauthorized access.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Employee Training:** Regularly educate employees about the risks of tailgating and how to recognize and prevent it.
- **Strict Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls, such as turnstiles or mantraps, to prevent unauthorized entry.
- **Security Personnel:** Station security personnel at entry points to monitor access and challenge unauthorized individuals.
- **Visitor Policies:** Enforce strict visitor policies, requiring guests to sign in and be escorted at all times.
- **Awareness Programs:** Develop ongoing security awareness programs to keep tailgating threats top of mind.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Human Courtesy:** Relies on the natural inclination of individuals to hold doors open for others.
- **Lack of Vigilance:** Takes advantage of employees who are not vigilant about verifying the identity of individuals entering secure areas.
- **Inadequate Physical Barriers:** Exploits weak or non-existent physical barriers at entry points.

## Common Tools/Techniques

- **Following Closely:** Simply walking closely behind an authorized person to gain access.
- **Distraction Techniques:** Engaging in conversation or creating a distraction to divert attention from the unauthorized entry.
- **Impersonation:** Posing as a delivery person, maintenance worker, or other trusted figure to gain access.

## Best Practices

- **Continuous Training:** Conduct regular training sessions to keep employees aware of the risks and prevention methods for tailgating.
- **Access Control Systems:** Use advanced access control systems, such as turnstiles or mantraps, to physically prevent tailgating.
- **Security Awareness:** Foster a culture of security awareness where employees feel empowered to challenge unknown individuals.
- **Regular Audits:** Perform regular audits of physical security measures and access control systems.
- **Incident Reporting:** Encourage a culture of reporting any suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts.

## Current Status

Tailgating remains a significant threat to physical security due to its reliance on human behavior and social norms. Continuous education, robust physical security measures, and a vigilant security culture are essential to mitigate these threats.
