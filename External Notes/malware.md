# Malware

Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. This encompasses a variety of cyber threats including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, [[ransomware]], [[spyware]], adware, and more. Malware acts against the interests of the computer user and can perform unauthorized actions on affected systems such as stealing, encrypting, or deleting sensitive data; altering or hijacking core computing functions; and monitoring users' computer activity without their permission. 

## Key Features

- **Stealth and Evasion Techniques**: Many malware variants are designed to evade detection by antivirus software through various methods such as polymorphism and [[encryption]].
- **Propagation Mechanisms**: Malware often includes the ability to spread itself across networks, to other computers via email, or through compromised websites.
- **Payload Delivery**: The harmful actions malware undertakes once it infects a system, ranging from data theft to system damage.
- **Command and Control**: Advanced malware communicates with a remote server for instructions, often enabling attackers to control infected systems remotely.

## Problem Addressed

Malware is developed and deployed by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in software and hardware, aiming to breach data privacy, compromise system integrity, and disrupt IT operations and services. It addresses the problem from an attacker's perspective, providing a tool for [[cyber espionage]], data theft, sabotage, and monetary gain through ransom demands.

## Implications

The presence and operation of malware within systems can lead to significant financial losses, damage to an organization's reputation, loss of sensitive or proprietary information, and could potentially endanger national security. It also raises concerns over privacy and identity theft for individuals.

## Impact

- **Economic Damage**: Costs associated with data breaches, system downtime, and malware removal can be substantial.
- **Security Breach**: Malware infections can lead to unauthorized access to systems and data breaches, compromising personal and corporate data.
- **Privacy Violation**: Spyware and certain types of malware can monitor user activities, violating privacy.
- **Operational Disruption**: Critical infrastructure and services can be disrupted, affecting businesses and the public.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Antivirus and Antimalware Software**: Programs designed to detect, prevent, and remove malware.
- **[[Firewalls]]**: Hardware and software solutions that block unauthorized access to networks.
- **Regular Software Updates**: Patching software can close vulnerabilities that malware exploits.
- **User Education**: Training on recognizing [[phishing]] attempts and malicious downloads can prevent malware infections.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Software Vulnerabilities**: Unpatched software flaws can be exploited by malware to gain unauthorized access.
- **[[Social Engineering Techniques|Social Engineering]]**: Tactics like [[phishing]] exploit human weaknesses to trick individuals into installing malware.
- **Weak Passwords**: Simple or default passwords can be easily guessed or cracked, allowing malware to spread across networks.

## Current Status

The malware landscape is continually evolving, with attackers developing new methods to evade detection and exploit emerging technologies. [[Ransomware]] attacks have seen a significant rise, targeting both large organizations and governments. Efforts to combat malware involve advancements in cybersecurity technologies, increased focus on cybersecurity awareness, and collaboration between organizations and governments.
