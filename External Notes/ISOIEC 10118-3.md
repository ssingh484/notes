# ISO/IEC 10118-3

ISO/IEC 10118-3 is part of the ISO/IEC 10118 series focusing on "Information technology — Security techniques — Hash-functions." This specific part of the standard addresses the requirements and guidelines for dedicated hash-functions, which are [[Hash Function|cryptographic hash functions]] designed for securing digital data.

## Key Features

- **Specificity for [[Hash Function|Cryptographic Hash Functions]]:** Provides detailed specifications for the construction and evaluation of dedicated [[Hash Function|hash functions]].
- **Security Criteria:** Outlines the criteria necessary to ensure that the [[Hash Function|hash functions]] are resistant to cryptographic attacks such as collision, pre-image, and second pre-image attacks.
- **Industry Relevance:** Widely acknowledged in various industries for ensuring the integrity and security of digital data through cryptographic means.

## How It Works

ISO/IEC 10118-3 details the mechanisms by which [[Hash Function|cryptographic hash functions]] can securely convert an input of any length into a fixed-size string of bytes. The standard ensures that these functions meet high-security standards necessary for modern cryptographic applications.

## Problem Addressed

The standard addresses the need for universally accepted guidelines and specifications for [[Hash Function|cryptographic hash functions]] that can be used in various security applications, including digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), and other forms of secure data verification.

## Implications

Adopting ISO/IEC 10118-3 is crucial for developers and security professionals who need reliable and secure [[Hash Function|cryptographic hash functions]]. It ensures consistency and reliability in the security measures employed across different systems and applications.

## Impact

The implementation of ISO/IEC 10118-3 enhances the security of digital systems by providing a standardized approach to [[hash function]] implementation, significantly reducing the risk of security breaches related to data integrity.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Standardized [[Hash Function|Hash Functions]]:** Ensures that only well-vetted, secure [[Hash Function|hash functions]] are used in commercial and private applications.
- **Detailed Security Specifications:** Provides specific instructions on how [[Hash Function|hash functions]] should be constructed to avoid vulnerabilities.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Adherence to the standard does not automatically guarantee security if not properly implemented or if additional, non-compliant modifications are made to the [[Hash Function|hash functions]].

## Common Tools/Software

Typically, cryptographic libraries that implement the [[Hash Function|hash functions]] specified in ISO/IEC 10118-3 are used across various programming environments. Examples include OpenSSL and other industry-standard cryptographic libraries.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Provides the requirements for an information security management system (ISMS), where cryptographic control is a vital element.
- **NIST Special Publications:** Offer complementary guidelines that often reference ISO standards for cryptographic techniques.

## Best Practices

- Ensure compliance with ISO/IEC 10118-3 when implementing [[Hash Function|cryptographic hash functions]].
