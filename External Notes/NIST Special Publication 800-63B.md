# NIST Special Publication 800-63B

NIST Special Publication 800-63B, titled "Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management," is part of a suite of documents that provide technical and procedural guidelines to federal agencies on identity assurance. This publication specifically addresses authentication and lifecycle management of identities in digital networks.

## Key Features

- **Authentication Requirements:** Defines levels of assurance for digital authentication of users, detailing requirements for each level regarding user identity verification, authentication, and authentication assurance.
- **Password and Authenticator Management:** Provides comprehensive guidelines on creating and managing secure passwords and other authenticators, including biometrics and cryptographic keys.
- **Lifecycle Considerations:** Outlines the management requirements throughout the lifecycle of authentication credentials, from creation to revocation.

## How It Works

NIST SP 800-63B categorizes authentication processes into three Assurance Levels:
1. **IAL1 (Identity Assurance Level 1):** Provides little or no confidence in the asserted identity's validity.
2. **IAL2 (Identity Assurance Level 2):** Provides high confidence in the asserted identity's validity.
3. **IAL3 (Identity Assurance Level 3):** Provides very high confidence in the asserted identity's validity.

Each level has specific requirements for identity proofing, authentication, and [[federation]] assurance that agencies must meet to ensure appropriate security levels based on the sensitivity and risks associated with the digital service.

## Problem Addressed

This publication addresses the challenge of securely authenticating users to access digital services. It aims to prevent unauthorized access, identity theft, and fraud in federal and other digital systems by standardizing the strength and quality of [[authentication mechanisms]].

## Implications

Adopting the guidelines can significantly enhance the security of digital systems by ensuring robust authentication practices that protect against various cyber threats. It helps organizations manage and mitigate risks associated with digital identities and their interactions.

## Impact

The guidelines in NIST SP 800-63B lead to stronger security protocols across services, enhancing trust in digital transactions and reducing the likelihood of fraud and cyber attacks due to compromised credentials.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Encourages the use of multiple authentication factors to increase security, especially for higher assurance levels.
- **Risk-Based Authentication:** Suggests implementing systems that adjust authentication requirements based on the user's behavior and data risk assessments.
- **Password Policies:** Recommends modern password policies, such as allowing longer and more complex passwords and discouraging periodic password changes unless there is evidence of compromise.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Without proper implementation, systems may still be vulnerable to attacks such as [[phishing]], credential stuffing, or brute force attacks, especially if additional factors of authentication are not used.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Identity Management Systems:** Platforms like Microsoft Azure Active Directory and Okta that can configure authentication policies in line with NIST guidelines.
- **MFA Tools:** Solutions such as Google Authenticator or Duo Security that provide multi-factor authentication capabilities.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Roadmap:** Provides strategic guidance and practices related to identity management and access control in federal agencies.
- **Cybersecurity Framework by NIST:** Helps businesses and organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk, complementing the identity guidelines.

## Best Practices

- Utilize multi-factor authentication for systems handling sensitive or personal data.
- Follow the lifecycle management guidelines to ensure that credentials are regularly updated and securely managed.
- Educate users about secure authentication practices to prevent common attacks like [[phishing]].
