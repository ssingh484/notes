# Hash Functions

Hash functions are mathematical [[Algorithm|algorithms]] that convert an input (or 'message') into a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a hash, that is unique to each unique input. They are designed to be a one-way function, making it computationally infeasible to reverse the process or derive the original input from the hash output.

## Key Features

- **Deterministic:** The same input always results in the same output.
- **Fixed Size:** Regardless of the input's size, the output (hash) has a constant size.
- **Efficiency:** Computes the hash value quickly, even for large data inputs.
- **Pre-image Resistance:** Difficult to reverse-engineer the original input from the hash output.
- **[[Collision Resistance]]:** Minimally likely that two different inputs will produce the same output hash.
- **Avalanche Effect:** A small change in the input should result in a significantly different hash output.

## How It Works

A hash function takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, referred to as the hash, appears random and changes significantly with an alteration of any bit of the input. These properties make hash functions useful for a variety of tasks in computing, from data integrity verification to secure password storage.

## Problem Addressed

Hash functions address the need for a quick and secure way to verify data integrity. They are used to ensure that data has not been altered, making them essential for secure software distribution, data retrieval, and more.

## Implications

Hash functions are critical in data security and [[cryptography]]. They underpin technologies like [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]] and authentication processes, where verifying the integrity and authenticity of data or communications is crucial.

## Impact

The widespread use of hash functions in security protocols has significantly enhanced data security across digital platforms. They provide a fast and reliable mechanism for validating data integrity, verifying identities, and securely storing passwords.

## Common Hash Functions

- **[[MD5]]:** Once widely used, now considered broken and vulnerable due to its susceptibility to collision attacks.
- **[[SHA-1]]:** Similar to [[MD5]], it is no longer considered secure against well-funded attackers.
- **[[SHA-256]] and [[SHA-3]]:** Part of the Secure Hash [[Algorithm]] family, these are currently recommended for most security applications requiring hash functions.
- **[[BLAKE2]]:** Known for high speed and high security, it is one of the fastest hash functions at comparable security levels.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST Special Publication 800-107,** "Recommendation for Applications Using Approved Hash Algorithms": Guides the use of hash functions in cryptographic applications.
- **[[ISOIEC 10118-3|ISO/IEC 10118-3]]:** Specifies hash-function algorithms suitable for further security techniques and applications.
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]]):** Encourages the use of hash functions to protect personal data and ensure privacy by design.

## Best Practices

- Avoid using deprecated hash functions like [[MD5]] and [[SHA-1]] for security-critical applications.
- Employ salt (a random value) with hashes, especially for password storage, to defend against rainbow table attacks.
- Regularly update cryptographic practices to incorporate advances in hash function technology and standards.

## Current Status

The field of hash functions is dynamically evolving, particularly with developments in [[quantum computing]] and new cryptographic analysis techniques. Ongoing research aims to develop even more robust and efficient hash functions.
