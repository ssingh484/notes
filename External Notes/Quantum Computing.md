# Quantum Computing

Quantum computing leverages principles of quantum mechanics, a fundamental theory in physics that describes the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles, to develop new ways to process information.

## Key Concepts

- **Qubits**: Unlike classical bits that can be either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.
- **Entanglement**: A quantum phenomenon where particles become interconnected and the state of one particle immediately affects the state of another, no matter the distance between them.
- **Quantum Supremacy**: The point at which a quantum computer can perform a task faster than classical computers can.

## Quantum Algorithms

- **[[Shor's Algorithm]]**: Capable of factoring large numbers exponentially faster than the best-known algorithms on classical computers. This poses a potential risk to classical encryption methods.
- **[[Grover's Algorithm]]**: Provides a quadratic speedup for database searching problems.

## Potential Applications

1. **[[Cryptography]]**: Quantum computers could potentially break several popular encryption schemes, leading to the rise of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.
2. **Drug Discovery**: Quantum computers might simulate molecular interactions at an unprecedented scale.
3. **Optimization Problems**: Solutions for traffic, energy distribution, and more.
4. **Artificial Intelligence**: Speeding up training for machine learning models.

## Challenges

- **Decoherence & Error Correction**: Quantum states can be fragile, leading to errors in calculations.
- **Scaling**: Building a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer remains a significant challenge.

## Current Status

- **Early Days**: While there's significant interest and investment in quantum computing, it's still in the early phases of development. Companies like IBM, Google, and Rigetti are making strides in the field.
- **Quantum Supremacy**: In 2019, Google claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy with its 53-qubit Sycamore processor.

## Implications for Traditional Computing

- **Encryption Vulnerabilities**: Quantum computing poses a risk to current cryptographic methods, prompting research into [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)]].
- **New Programming Paradigms**: Quantum computing requires a different approach, leading to the rise of quantum programming languages and quantum software.
