# Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital [[Decentralized Ledgers|ledger]] that records transactions across multiple computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This technology underpins digital currencies like Bitcoin and is used in a variety of other applications such as supply chain monitoring, secure voting systems, and identity verification.

## How It Works

- **Transactions:** Each transaction conducted within a blockchain is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system.
- **Blocks:** Once a transaction is verified, it is combined with other transactions to create a new data block for the ledger.
- **Chain:** Each new block is linked to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks with information of all transactions made in the history of that blockchain.
- **Encryption and Validation:** Transactions are securely encrypted, and each block is uniquely linked to its preceding block through a cryptographic hash, enhancing the security and integrity of the overall chain.

## Key Features

- **Decentralization:** Unlike traditional ledgers, a blockchain does not rely on a central authority to oversee and validate transactions.
- **Transparency:** Changes to the public blockchain are publicly viewable by all parties creating transparency, and all transactions are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Security:** Uses cryptographic hashing and consensus algorithms to ensure the integrity and chronological order of the blockchain.

## Problem Addressed

Blockchain addresses the problem of trust in digital transactions. By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied or altered, blockchain technology creates backbone of a new type of internet where transactions are secure, transparent, and decentralized.

## Implications

The implications of blockchain technology extend beyond its role in cryptocurrency. Industries that rely on legacy data storage and transaction methods can leverage blockchain for improved transparency, enhanced security, and increased efficiency in transactions.

## Impact

Blockchain can significantly alter industries, including finance, healthcare, and law, by providing a secure, fast, and cheaper means of conducting and recording transactions without the need for a centralized authority.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Cryptographic Hashes:** Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a secure and unalterable chain.
- **Proof of Work/Proof of Stake:** Mechanisms that add new blocks to the blockchain involve complex algorithms that provide additional layers of security.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

While blockchain itself is highly secure, applications built on blockchain technology can still be vulnerable. Smart contracts, for example, can contain bugs that might be exploited if not properly audited.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Ethereum:** A decentralized platform that runs smart contracts.
- **Hyperledger Fabric:** An open source collaborative effort created to advance blockchain technology by addressing important features for a blockchain to be effective in various business scenarios.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **ISO/TC 307:** ISO standard for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, providing guidance on privacy, security, governance, and more.
- **NIST Blockchain Technology Overview:** Provides an introduction to blockchain technology, covering its architecture, consensus models, and security considerations.

## Best Practices

- Regularly audit smart contract codes and blockchain implementations for vulnerabilities.
- Ensure thorough testing and validation of blockchain applications before full-scale deployment.
- Maintain an understanding of blockchainâ€™s limitations, particularly concerning throughput and latency.

## Current Status

Blockchain technology continues to evolve, with ongoing research into scalability, energy consumption, and integration with other technologies like IoT and AI.
