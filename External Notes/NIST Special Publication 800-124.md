# NIST Special Publication 800-124

NIST Special Publication 800-124, "Guidelines on Cell Phone and PDA Security," is a comprehensive document produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It provides guidelines for securing mobile devices such as cell phones and PDAs within federal organizations, with applicable insights for broader industries. The publication outlines best practices for managing the security of mobile devices throughout their lifecycle, from deployment to disposal.

## Key Features

- **Risk Assessment:** Guides organizations in assessing the security risks associated with the use of mobile devices.
- **Security Policy Development:** Provides a framework for developing and implementing security policies specific to mobile devices.
- **Device Management:** Covers strategies for effectively managing the security of mobile devices, including configuration, data protection, and incident response.
- **User Training and Support:** Emphasizes the importance of user training in maintaining mobile device security.

## How It Works

NIST SP 800-124 provides a set of recommended actions and considerations for enhancing the security of mobile devices:

- **Device Setup and Configuration:** Guidelines for secure initial setup and ongoing configuration of mobile devices.
- **Authentication and [[Encryption]]:** Recommends strong authentication methods and data [[encryption]] to protect sensitive information stored on and transmitted by mobile devices.
- **Application Management:** Offers advice on securing applications on mobile devices, including the approval and monitoring of apps used in a corporate environment.
- **Security Incident Response:** Outlines procedures for responding to security incidents involving mobile devices, such as data breaches or loss/theft of a device.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Security:** Helps organizations protect sensitive information against unauthorized access and cyber threats.
- **Improved Compliance:** Supports compliance with federal regulations concerning information security.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Provides strategies to identify and mitigate risks associated with mobile devices.
- **User Awareness:** Raises awareness among users about the security threats to mobile devices and the necessary precautions to take.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)|Federal Information Security Management Act]] ([[Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)|FISMA]]):** Requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to secure their information and information systems, including mobile devices.
- **[[NIST Cybersecurity Framework]]:** While more general, it complements SP 800-124 by providing a broader framework for managing cybersecurity risks.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Updates:** Keep the device's operating system and applications updated to protect against vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Configuration:** Apply security settings that minimize exposure to threats.
- **Data Backup:** Regularly backup data stored on mobile devices to prevent loss.
- **Physical Security:** Implement measures to secure the physical access to mobile devices.

## Current Status

As mobile technology evolves, NIST SP 800-124 continues to be updated to address new security challenges and technological advances. The guidelines are periodically revised to incorporate the latest best practices and security measures.
