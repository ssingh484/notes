## Definition

Authentication protocols are rules and standards designed to verify the identity of individuals or entities in computer systems. They ensure that a user, device, or application is genuinely who or what it claims to be before granting access to sensitive data or systems.

## Key Features

- **Password-Based Authentication:** Uses a username-password mechanism.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Adds an additional layer of security, often using a mobile device.
- **Biometric Authentication:** Uses unique biological traits for verification.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Allows users to access multiple services with one set of login credentials.

## Implications

These protocols play a fundamental role in protecting systems from unauthorized access and data breaches. The choice of protocol can significantly impact the security and user experience.

## Current Status

The field is moving towards more secure and user-friendly methods, like biometric authentication and decentralized systems, to counteract the increasing sophistication of cyber threats.
