# Mimikatz

Mimikatz is a powerful open-source tool primarily used for Windows security research and as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate known vulnerabilities in the Windows [[authentication protocols]]. It is commonly employed by both system administrators and attackers to retrieve passwords and credential data from Windows systems.

## How It Works

Mimikatz operates by exploiting security vulnerabilities in the way Windows handles authentication processes. Key techniques include:
- **Pass-the-Hash:** Extracts and uses password hashes to authenticate without needing the actual password.
- **Pass-the-Ticket:** Steals [[Kerberos]] tickets which can be used to impersonate legitimate users.
- **Wdigest and LSASS Dump:** Extracts plaintext passwords directly from memory by interacting with the Windows Security Subsystem.

## Key Features

- **Versatility:** Capable of performing a wide range of tasks related to Windows security, such as extracting plain text passwords, hashes, PIN codes, and [[Kerberos]] tickets.
- **Credential Extraction:** Efficient at extracting various types of credentials from the Windows Credential Vault.
- **Ease of Use:** Despite its powerful capabilities, Mimikatz features commands that are straightforward to execute for users with basic knowledge of Windows systems.

## Advantages

- **Diagnostic Utility:** Helps system administrators test and improve their security posture by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.
- **Research and Education:** Useful for security researchers and educators in demonstrating and studying the behavior of network protocols and authentication systems.
- **Incident Response:** Assists in understanding how breaches occur and in performing forensic activities during cybersecurity incident responses.

- **Tutorials:**
  - **Gentilkiwi's Blog:** The creator of Mimikatz often publishes detailed tutorials and use-case scenarios on [his blog](https://blog.gentilkiwi.com).
  - **YouTube Tutorials:** Numerous tutorials are available on YouTube, providing step-by-step instructions on using Mimikatz for educational purposes.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-63B]],** "Digital Identity Guidelines": Although not specifically mentioning Mimikatz, this publication provides guidelines on mitigating threats against authentication systems, relevant to the types of vulnerabilities Mimikatz exploits.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Offers a framework for information security management systems that should include protection measures against the types of attacks that tools like Mimikatz facilitate.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

While Mimikatz itself is a tool, the main vulnerabilities it exploits are related to improper configurations and weak security practices in Windows environments, such as inadequate password policies and lack of multi-factor authentication.

## Best Practices

- **Limiting Local Administrator Rights:** Reducing privileges can help mitigate the effectiveness of Mimikatz.
- **Enabling LSA Protection:** Configuring the system to run the Local Security Authority (LSA) process in a protected mode to prevent unauthorized memory access.
- **Using Windows Defender Credential Guard:** Helps prevent Mimikatz from accessing credential data stored in memory.
- **Regularly Updating Systems:** Keeping software up-to-date to protect against known vulnerabilities and exploits that Mimikatz may use.

## Current Status

Mimikatz continues to evolve, with its developer actively maintaining the project and expanding its capabilities. It remains a critical tool for cybersecurity professionals and a popular tool among attackers, illustrating the ongoing arms race in information security.
