# Threat Hunting

Threat Hunting is a proactive cybersecurity practice aimed at detecting and isolating advanced threats that evade existing security measures. This process involves a set of techniques and tools used by security teams to actively search for, identify, and remove stealthy threats before they cause harm.

## Key Features

- **Proactive Search**: Unlike passive security measures, threat hunting involves actively searching for threats that have not triggered any alerts.
- **Hypothesis-Driven**: Hunters formulate hypotheses based on knowledge of potential attackers and threats to guide their investigation.
- **Use of Advanced Tools**: Utilizes sophisticated cybersecurity tools to analyze and correlate data from various sources.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The insights gained from each hunt refine techniques and strategies, enhancing future hunts.

## Searching For:

- [[Data Poisoning]]


## Problem Addressed

Threat hunting addresses the limitations of traditional, reactive security measures by seeking to identify and mitigate threats before they manifest into significant breaches. This approach is crucial in the detection of sophisticated, low and slow threats that typically remain under the radar.

## Implications

The adoption of threat hunting can significantly improve an organizationâ€™s security posture by adding a layer of proactive defense that anticipates and combats sophisticated attacks.

## Impact

- **Direct Effects**: Reduction in the duration and severity of breaches. Early detection allows for quicker response and mitigation, limiting damage.
- **Long-Term Influence**: Builds a more resilient security posture, enhances detection capabilities, and reduces overall security risks.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Behavioral Analytics**: Leveraging machine learning and AI to detect anomalies and patterns indicative of malicious activities.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Tools that record and store endpoint-system-level behaviors, use various data analytics techniques to detect suspicious system behavior, provide contextual information, block malicious activity, and remediate the effects of potential threats.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Utilizing known information about existing threats to inform hunting activities.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Skill Gap**: Effective threat hunting requires a high level of expertise and knowledge, which can be scarce.
- **Resource Intensive**: It demands significant resources, including advanced tools and skilled personnel, which may not be feasible for all organizations.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Splunk**: Provides big data analytics for security insights.
- **Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK Stack)**: Popular for managing logs and event data to aid in threat detection.
- **CrowdStrike Falcon**: Offers next-generation antivirus protection and endpoint detection and response.

## Current Status

As of the latest developments, threat hunting is becoming an essential component of advanced cybersecurity strategies. Organizations are increasingly aware of its value in pre-empting major security incidents.
