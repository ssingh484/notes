# ISO/IEC 27018

ISO/IEC 27018 is an international standard that provides guidelines for protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in public cloud computing environments. It acts as a code of practice for public cloud service providers handling personal data, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and enhancing customer trust.

## Key Features

- **PII Protection:** Specifies controls for the protection of personal data processed by cloud service providers.
- **Transparency:** Requires cloud providers to be transparent about their practices, including sub-processing and data handling.
- **Data Control:** Ensures that cloud customers retain control over their data and can access information on how their data is processed.

## How It Works

ISO/IEC 27018 works by providing a framework that cloud service providers can follow to manage PII securely. It extends the controls from [[ISOIEC 27002|ISO/IEC 27002]] to include privacy-specific requirements, ensuring that data privacy considerations are met throughout the process of storing, processing, and transmitting personal data in the cloud.

## Common Techniques

- **Contractual Measures:** Implementing strong contractual obligations to protect PII and define the responsibilities of cloud providers.
- **Access Control:** Tightening access control to PII to ensure that only authorized personnel have access based on the principle of least privilege.
- **Data [[Encryption]]:** Encrypting PII both at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Audit and Compliance:** Conducting regular audits and compliance checks to ensure adherence to privacy standards and regulations.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Compliance:** Helps cloud service providers comply with global data protection regulations, such as the [[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]].
- **Increased Trust:** Builds customer confidence by demonstrating commitment to privacy and data protection.
- **Competitive Advantage:** Offers cloud service providers a competitive edge in markets where privacy and data protection are prioritized.

## Major Tools

- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Tools:** Such as Symantec, McAfee, and Digital Guardian, which help detect and prevent data breaches of PII.
- **Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs):** Tools like Netskope, McAfee MVISION Cloud, and Microsoft Cloud App Security that enforce security policies in cloud environments.
- **Privacy Management Software:** Platforms like OneTrust and TrustArc that help organizations manage compliance with privacy regulations.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]]):** The principles and controls of ISO/IEC 27018 align with [[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] requirements, helping organizations meet EU privacy standards.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Integrates with the broader framework of [[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]] for implementing an information security management system (ISMS) with a focus on privacy.
- **[[ISOIEC 27002|ISO/IEC 27002]]:** Builds on the security controls from [[ISOIEC 27002|ISO/IEC 27002]] by adding privacy considerations specifically for cloud environments.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that PII is only processed in accordance with the consent provided by the data subjects.
- Maintain transparency with customers about how their PII is being handled and processed.
- Implement strict security measures and regular audits to manage and protect PII effectively.
- Train staff regularly on privacy policies and the importance of protecting PII.

## Current Status

As concerns over data privacy continue to grow, ISO/IEC 27018 remains a crucial standard for cloud service providers, helping them navigate the complex landscape of global [[privacy laws and regulations]]. The standard is periodically updated to reflect changes in legal requirements and best practices in data protection.
