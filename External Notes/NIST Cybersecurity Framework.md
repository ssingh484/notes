# NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary framework primarily intended for critical infrastructure organizations to manage and mitigate cybersecurity risk. Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), it provides a set of industry standards and best practices to help organizations manage cybersecurity risks.

## Key Features

- **Core Functions:** The Framework is organized into five concurrent and continuous Functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These Functions provide a high-level strategic view of an organization's management of cybersecurity risks.
- **Profiles:** Enable organizations to align their cybersecurity activities with their business requirements, risk tolerances, and resources.
- **Tiers:** Describe the degree to which an organization’s cybersecurity risk management practices exhibit the characteristics defined in the Framework (from Partial to Adaptive).

## Problem Addressed

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework addresses the need for a standardized approach to managing cybersecurity risk that is flexible enough to be implemented across diverse sectors and organizations. It helps bridge the gap between non-technical and technical stakeholders.

## Implications

Implementing the Framework can help organizations apply the principles and best practices of risk management to improving security and resilience. The Framework helps organizations manage and reduce their cybersecurity risks, while also enhancing resilience during and after a cyber attack.

## Impact

The Framework has been widely adopted across various sectors and is considered a benchmark for establishing a robust cybersecurity posture. It not only helps organizations manage and reduce risks but also aids in compliance with existing regulations and requirements.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Risk Assessment Tools:** Utilized to identify vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Protective Technology:** Implemented to ensure the security and resilience of systems and assets.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Enables ongoing awareness of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Incident Response Plans:** Prepared to address detected cybersecurity events.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

If not fully integrated or regularly updated, the Framework’s implementation may fall short, leaving organizations vulnerable to evolving cybersecurity threats.

## Common Tools/Software

- **[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)|Security Information and Event Management]] ([[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)|SIEM]]) Systems:** Tools like Splunk, IBM QRadar, and LogRhythm are often used to support the Detect function of the Framework.
- **Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) Platforms:** Such as RSA Archer or MetricStream, which can help in aligning with the Framework’s Profiles and Tiers.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **Executive Order 13636:** "Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity," which initiated the development of the Framework.
- **[[Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)|FISMA]] ([[Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)|Federal Information Security Management Act]]):** Aligns federal agency security practices, complementing the Framework’s structure.
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]]):** Although an EU regulation, the principles of the Framework can help organizations meet [[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]]’s security requirements.

## Best Practices

- Customize the Framework to fit the specific contexts and needs of your organization.
- Engage all parts of the organization in implementing the Framework, ensuring it is integrated into the broader risk management strategy.
- Regularly review and update the cybersecurity practices to keep pace with [[emerging threats]] and technologies.

## Current Status

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework continues to evolve, reflecting changes in technology and cybersecurity practices. It remains a dynamic tool that organizations adapt to their needs and is updated periodically by NIST based on user feedback and changes in the cybersecurity landscape.
