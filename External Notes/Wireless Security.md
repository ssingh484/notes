# Wireless Security

Wireless Security encompasses the protection of wireless networks, including Wi-Fi and other wireless communication technologies, from unauthorized access and attacks. This involves implementing security measures that safeguard data integrity, confidentiality, and availability over wireless channels.

## Key Features

- **Encryption:** Uses protocols like WPA2 and WPA3 to encrypt data transmitted over wireless networks.
- **Authentication:** Employs methods such as passwords, digital certificates, and multi-factor authentication to verify user identity.
- **Access Control:** Restricts network access to authorized devices and users only.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention:** Monitors for and responds to malicious activities or policy violations.

## Problem Addressed

Wireless networks are inherently vulnerable due to their broadcast nature, which allows signals to be available beyond the physical boundaries controlled by the network administrator. Wireless Security addresses threats such as eavesdropping, unauthorized access, and the exploitation of wireless vulnerabilities.

## Implications

Inadequate wireless security can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and network downtime. Effective wireless security practices are critical for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the reliability of wireless communications in personal, public, and business environments.

## Impact

Strong wireless security measures prevent attackers from accessing or disrupting wireless networks, thereby protecting organizational assets and user privacy. This is crucial for maintaining trust in wireless technologies as a secure means of communication and data transmission.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Robust Encryption:** Implementing strong encryption standards such as WPA3 for protecting data in transit.
- **Secure Authentication Protocols:** Utilizing advanced authentication methods to ensure that only authorized users and devices can access the network.
- **Regular Software Updates:** Keeping wireless infrastructure such as routers and connected devices updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Weak passwords, outdated encryption standards, and unpatched firmware are common vulnerabilities in wireless networks. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or intercept sensitive information.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS):** AirMagnet, Cisco Adaptive Wireless IPS.
- **Network Monitoring Tools:** Wireshark, Kismet.
- **Encryption Tools:** Built-in tools in access points supporting WPA3 encryption.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST Special Publication 800-153, "Guidelines for Securing Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)"**: Provides recommendations for securing wireless networks and managing wireless security risks.
- **FCC Guidelines on Wireless Security**: Outlines best practices for enhancing the security of wireless communications and infrastructure.

## Best Practices

- Use the latest encryption standards like WPA3 for all wireless communications.
- Regularly change and strengthen wireless network passwords.
- Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) which is known to have vulnerabilities.
- Keep firmware on wireless devices up-to-date to protect against the latest threats.
- Isolate guest networks from the main network to restrict access to sensitive information.

## Current Status

Wireless security continues to evolve with advancements in technology and security protocols, such as the introduction of WPA3 and ongoing improvements in authentication and access control mechanisms.
