# Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are [[network security]] tools designed to detect and prevent identified threats from causing harm. Unlike [[Intrusion Detection Systems]] ([[Intrusion Detection Systems|IDS]]) that only detect and alert, IPS actively intervenes by blocking potentially harmful activities as they are detected in real-time.

## Key Features

- **Active Threat Prevention:** Automatically takes actions such as blocking, redirecting, or modifying traffic to prevent attacks.
- **Inline Deployment:** Situated directly within the data flow of a network, examining and acting on all incoming and outgoing traffic.
- **Signature-Based and Anomaly-Based Detection:** Utilizes known signatures of malicious activity as well as deviations from normal behavior patterns to identify threats.
- **Automated Response:** Configured to execute predefined actions without human intervention, enhancing response times and effectiveness.

## Problem Addressed

IPS address the limitations of traditional [[firewalls]] and [[Intrusion Detection Systems|IDS]] by not only detecting but also preventing a wide range of attacks, including but not limited to zero-day exploits, network worms, and malicious payloads before they execute.

## Implications

Deploying IPS can significantly improve an organization's security posture by adding a proactive layer of defense that actively works to mitigate threats, thus reducing the likelihood of successful attacks and the potential impact of security breaches.

## Impact

IPS systems enhance the security measures within a network by reducing the exposure to and impact of attacks. They help in maintaining operational continuity and protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access and potential exfiltration.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Deep Packet Inspection:** Examines the contents of packets at a granular level to detect hidden exploits.
- **Traffic Normalization:** Reassembles network traffic to eliminate malicious content before it reaches the target.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Learns the behavior of networked applications to identify anomalies that may indicate a breach.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

If not properly updated and configured, IPS can block legitimate traffic, leading to disruptions in network services. Sophisticated attackers may employ techniques like encryption or fragmentation to evade detection by IPS.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Cisco Firepower**
- **Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation [[Firewalls|Firewall]]**
- **Fortinet FortiGate**

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST SP 800-94, "Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)"**: Offers detailed information on implementing and managing IPS technologies.
- **NIST SP 800-53, "Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations"**: Recommends practices for intrusion prevention as part of an overall security strategy.

## Best Practices

- Regularly update IPS signatures and anomaly detection algorithms to keep up with new threats.
- Carefully tune the system settings to balance security with network performance to minimize false positives and false negatives.
- Integrate IPS with other security tools like SIEM systems for enhanced monitoring and comprehensive threat management.

## Current Status

IPS technology continues to evolve, incorporating advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve threat detection and response capabilities. The focus is increasingly on developing adaptive IPS that can automatically adjust to new threats in dynamic network environments.
