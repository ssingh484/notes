# OWASP API Security Top 10

The OWASP API Security Top 10 is a list of the most critical security risks to [[APIs|application programming interfaces]] ([[APIs]]) compiled by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). This resource aims to raise awareness and provide guidance on mitigating common [[APIs|API]] security issues, helping developers, architects, and security professionals secure their APIs against potential threats.

## Key Features

- **Risk Identification:** Categorizes the top threats to [[API security]] based on their prevalence, impact, and exploitability.
- **Guidance and Best Practices:** Offers detailed explanations of each risk along with practical recommendations for prevention and mitigation.
- **Community-Driven:** Developed and updated by the security community, ensuring it reflects current trends and emerging threats in [[API security]].

## How It Works

The OWASP API Security Top 10 list is structured as follows:

1. **API1: Broken Object Level Authorization**
    - Misconfigurations in object-level controls that allow users to access objects they shouldnâ€™t.
2. **API2: Broken User Authentication**
    - Flaws in [[authentication mechanisms]] that allow attackers to compromise authentication tokens or exploit implementation flaws.
3. **API3: Excessive Data Exposure**
    - Exposing more data than necessary in [[APIs|API]] responses, which could be leveraged by attackers.
4. **API4: Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting**
    - Failing to limit the size or frequency of requests, leading to [[APIs|API]] abuse or service downtime.
5. **API5: Broken Function Level Authorization**
    - Insufficient access controls that allow users to perform tasks outside of their permissions.
6. **API6: Mass Assignment**
    - Binding client-provided data to data models without proper filtering, leading to entity modifications.
7. **API7: Security Misconfiguration**
    - Insecure default configurations, incomplete configurations, and open cloud storage, among others.
8. **API8: Injection**
    - Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, and command injection, where untrusted data is sent as part of a command or query.
9. **API9: Improper Assets Management**
    - Exposing outdated or unnecessary [[APIs]] that may not be adequately secured.
10. **API10: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**
    - Inadequate logging and monitoring that prevent or delay the detection of security breaches.

## Problem Addressed

OWASP API Security Top 10 addresses the need for specific guidance on securing [[APIs]], which are often critical gateways to business logic and data in modern applications. It highlights the areas where [[APIs]] are most vulnerable to attacks, helping organizations focus their security efforts effectively.

## Implications

Given the critical role of [[APIs]] in modern software architectures, vulnerabilities can lead to significant data breaches, unauthorized access, and business disruptions. Awareness and mitigation of these risks are crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of applications.

## Impact

Adopting the practices recommended in the OWASP API Security Top 10 can significantly reduce the risk of [[APIs|API]] security breaches, protect sensitive data, and enhance the overall security posture of an organization.

## Defense Mechanisms

- Implement robust authentication and authorization controls.
- Employ rate limiting and input/output filtering to reduce abuse.
- Configure secure defaults and regular security audits to prevent misconfigurations.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Each category in the Top 10 highlights specific weaknesses that could be exploited if not adequately addressed, such as insufficient data protection, weak authentication methods, and inadequate monitoring.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools:** Identify potential security flaws in source code that corresponds to the risks listed in the OWASP API Security Top 10.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools:** Test deployed applications and [[APIs]] to find vulnerabilities that occur at runtime.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Supports the secure management of [[APIs]] as part of an organization's information security management system.
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] and other privacy laws:** Demand secure [[APIs|API]] practices to protect personal data from unauthorized access or breaches.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and update security practices in line with the OWASP API Security Top 10 recommendations.
- Conduct thorough testing and code reviews focused on [[APIs|API]] security.
- Train development and security teams on [[APIs|API]] security risks and mitigation strategies.

## Current Status

The OWASP API Security Top 10 is periodically updated to reflect new security challenges and advances in technology. Staying updated with the latest version is crucial for maintaining effective [[APIs|API]] security measures.
