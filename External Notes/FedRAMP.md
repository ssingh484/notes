# Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)

FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) is a U.S. government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP is designed to ensure that all federal data is consistently protected at high levels of security across all government agencies.

## Key Features

- **Standardization:** Provides a set of standard security requirements for all cloud service providers (CSPs) that serve the federal government, ensuring uniformity in security practices.
- **Risk Management Framework:** Adopts the NIST [[Risk Management Framework]] tailored specifically for cloud services, enhancing the security and risk posture of government data.
- **Three-Tiered Approach:** Includes three levels of security (Low, Moderate, and High) that align with the sensitivity of the data being handled and processed.

## How It Works

FedRAMP simplifies the process of securing cloud services by using a "do once, use many times" framework. CSPs undergo an initial rigorous assessment from a third-party assessment organization (3PAO) to ensure they meet FedRAMP requirements. Once authorized, the same security assessment can be used by other federal agencies, reducing redundancy and costs.

## Common Techniques

- **Security Assessments:** Comprehensive evaluations involving vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify security weaknesses.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Ongoing oversight of cloud service security to quickly detect and respond to threats.
- **Incident Management:** Procedures and tools for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents.

## Advantages

- **Efficiency:** Reduces the effort and expense related to redundant agency security assessments.
- **Enhanced Security:** Provides high standards of security measures and continuous monitoring, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Collaboration:** Promotes the sharing of information regarding threats and vulnerabilities among federal agencies and CSPs.

## Major Tools

- **FedRAMP Marketplace:** A platform where federal agencies can find cloud service offerings that have been authorized through the FedRAMP process.
- **Automated Continuous Monitoring Tools:** Software solutions that help CSPs comply with FedRAMPâ€™s continuous monitoring requirements.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST Special Publications:** FedRAMP builds on the security controls outlined in NIST SP 800-53, providing cloud-specific security guidance.
- **FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act):** FedRAMP supports compliance with FISMA, which requires federal data to be protected with appropriate security measures.

## Best Practices

- **Adherence to FedRAMP Templates:** CSPs should follow the FedRAMP Security Assessment Framework closely using provided templates and guidance.
- **Regular Training and Awareness:** Ensuring that teams understand FedRAMP requirements and participate in regular training on security best practices.
- **Engagement with 3PAOs:** Working closely with accredited third-party assessment organizations to prepare and maintain FedRAMP authorization.

## Current Status

As cloud technology evolves, FedRAMP continues to adapt and update its policies to ensure it remains effective against modern threats. The program is critical in facilitating the adoption of cloud technologies in government while ensuring that data security is never compromised.
