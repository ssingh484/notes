# Network Scanning and Enumeration

Network Scanning and Enumeration involve the use of tools and techniques to identify devices, services, and vulnerabilities within a network. This process helps administrators understand the network's layout and security posture by actively probing systems, services, and devices.

## How It Works

Network scanning starts with the discovery of active devices on a network using IP addresses. Enumeration follows, which involves more detailed queries to identify operating systems, applications, user accounts, and other network services. The collected data is then analyzed to assess [[network security]], compliance, and operational status.

## Key Features

- **Device Discovery:** Identifies all devices connected to a network, including servers, routers, switches, and [[firewalls]].
- **Port Scanning:** Checks open ports on network devices to determine available services and applications.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Detects security weaknesses in systems and networks that could be exploited by attackers.
- **OS Fingerprinting:** Determines the operating systems running on networked devices.

## Common Techniques

- **Ping Sweeps:** Uses ICMP echo requests to identify active hosts.
- **SYN Scans:** A form of TCP scanning that sends a SYN packet and awaits a response to assess port status without establishing a full connection.
- **UDP Scans:** Identifies open UDP ports by sending packets and analyzing responses or lack thereof.
- **Service Version Detection:** Queries ports to determine the application and version number of services running on open ports.

## Advantages

- **Security Enhancement:** Identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that can be remedied to prevent potential breaches.
- **Network Optimization:** Helps in network management by providing insights into the network structure and utilization.
- **Compliance Assurance:** Assists in ensuring compliance with security policies and standards by regular monitoring and auditing of network assets.
- **Incident Response:** Facilitates rapid identification and resolution of network issues or breaches.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-115]],** "Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment": Provides guidelines for network scanning as part of an overall security assessment strategy.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS), which includes provisions for regular network scanning.
- **[[PCI DSS]] ([[PCI DSS|Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]]):** Requires regular network scanning to protect cardholder data environments.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Nmap:** A free and open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing.
- **Wireshark:** Network protocol analyzer that lets you capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.
- **Nessus:** A widely used vulnerability scanner that analyzes [[network security]] for potential risks.
- **Metasploit:** Provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in [[penetration testing]] and [[Intrusion Detection Systems|IDS]] signature development.

## Best Practices

- Conduct network scanning and enumeration regularly to keep up-to-date with the network status and emerging vulnerabilities.
- Ensure all scanning activities are authorized and documented to avoid legal and ethical issues.
- Integrate scanning results into the broader security management process for timely remediation of identified risks.
- Use comprehensive tools that provide both scanning and enumeration capabilities to maximize efficiency and coverage.

## Current Status

As networks grow in complexity and scale, network scanning and enumeration continue to evolve with enhancements in speed, accuracy, and integration with other security tools. This evolution is critical to adapting to the dynamic nature of [[network security]] threats and technologies.
