# Network Access Control (NAC)

Network Access Control (NAC) is a security solution that enforces policy-based access control to network resources. NAC systems evaluate the credentials of a device and its compliance with security policies before allowing access to the network, thereby managing and restricting the devices that can connect to and communicate over a network.

## Key Features

- **Device Authentication:** Verifies the identity of devices trying to connect to the network using credentials like MAC addresses or digital certificates.
- **Compliance Checks:** Assesses devices for compliance with the network's security policies, such as having the latest antivirus updates, required software patches, and appropriate security configurations.
- **Role-based Access Control:** Grants access to network resources based on the role of the user and the device within the organization.
- **Post-Admission Control:** Continuously monitors and enforces security policies on devices after they are granted access to the network.

## Problem Addressed

NAC addresses security challenges related to the growing number of devices accessing networks, including unauthorized access, non-compliance with security policies, and the potential spread of [[malware]]. It ensures that only compliant and authorized devices can access and operate within the network.

## Implications

Implementing NAC is crucial for organizations to protect sensitive data from threats posed by device vulnerabilities, especially in environments with high device turnover or guest access, such as educational institutions, hospitals, and corporations.

## Impact

NAC significantly enhances [[network security]] by preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that all devices comply with security standards before they can access network resources. This reduces the risk of [[malware]] infections and data breaches originating from compromised or non-compliant devices.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Endpoint Security Enforcement:** Ensures that all devices meet the organization's security standards.
- **Network Segmentation:** Limits access to sensitive parts of the network based on device compliance and user role.
- **Guest Network Access:** Provides controlled network access for guests, separate from the main network.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

If not regularly updated or properly configured, NAC systems can be bypassed through spoofing or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the NAC software itself. Additionally, overly permissive access policies can diminish the effectiveness of NAC solutions.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Cisco ISE (Identity Services Engine):** Provides secure network access with device visibility and control.
- **Aruba ClearPass:** Offers robust network access control, including guest access management and endpoint compliance.
- **ForeScout CounterACT:** Specializes in device visibility and automated response to security incidents.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST Special Publication 800-53,** "Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations": Recommends network access control measures to enhance security.
- **ISO/IEC 27001,** "Information Security Management": Specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system, under which NAC can be essential for access control.

## Best Practices

- Continuously update and patch NAC systems to protect against vulnerabilities.
- Define strict access control policies based on the least privilege principle.
- Regularly review and update access policies to adapt to new security challenges and organizational changes.
- Implement a separate NAC policy for guest access to ensure network integrity.

## Current Status

As the number of connected devices continues to grow, NAC solutions are increasingly important for ensuring [[network security]]. Advances in NAC technologies now incorporate machine learning and AI to better identify and respond to security threats in real time.
