# BIKE (Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation)

BIKE (Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation) is a [[key encapsulation]] mechanism that is part of the ongoing [[NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization]] process. It is designed to be resistant to attacks from [[Quantum Computing|quantum computers]] and operates on the hardness of decoding random linear codes, specifically based on the problem of decoding a random quasicyclic moderate-density parity-check (MDPC) code.

## How It Works

BIKE operates by generating a pair of keys—a [[public key]] and a [[private key]]—using error-correcting codes. The [[public key]] is derived from a parity-check matrix of an MDPC code, while the [[private key]] consists of a structured version of this matrix that makes decoding feasible.

- **Key Generation:** Involves creating a structured random parity-check matrix for the MDPC code, from which the [[public key]] and [[private key]] are derived.
- **[[Key Encapsulation]]:** The sender uses the recipient's [[public key]] to encrypt a message, which involves adding error vectors to encoded messages, ensuring only the holder of the [[private key]] can decode it effectively.
- **[[Key Decapsulation]]:** The receiver uses their [[private key]] to decode the received message, leveraging the structure of their [[private key]] to correct the errors and retrieve the original message.

## Advantages

- **Quantum Resilience:** Designed to be secure against both classical and [[Quantum Computing|quantum computer]] attacks, making it suitable for future-proofing cryptographic needs.
- **Efficiency:** Has relatively low computational requirements compared to other post-quantum candidates, which can make it suitable for environments with limited resources.
- **Simplicity:** The [[algorithm]] is based on well-understood principles of coding theory, making its implementation straightforward in terms of conceptual understanding.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization]]:** BIKE is part of the NIST efforts to standardize [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)|post-quantum cryptographic algorithms]]. This involves rigorous evaluation for security and performance to ensure suitability for replacing current [[encryption]] standards in the face of [[quantum computing]].
- **ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27:** Works on international standards for the security techniques concerning IT systems and tools, including those related to [[cryptography]], potentially affecting how BIKE and similar [[Algorithm|algorithms]] are standardized globally.

## Major Tools Used

- **BIKE Reference Implementation:** Provided by the BIKE team as part of the [[NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization|NIST PQC project]], available for public use and testing.
- **Open Quantum Safe (libOQS):** An open-source library that aims to support the development and prototyping of [[quantum-resistant]] [[cryptography]]. BIKE has been integrated into this library for testing and benchmarking against other post-quantum schemes.

## Current Status

As of the latest updates, BIKE is one of the candidate [[Algorithm|algorithms]] in the third round of the [[NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization]] process. It is being closely analyzed for security vulnerabilities, performance metrics, and implementation feasibility before potentially being standardized as a recommended post-quantum cryptographic method.
