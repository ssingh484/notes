up:: [[Single Sign-On and Federation]]
# Federation 

In the context of [[Identity and Access Management]] ([[Identity and Access Management|IAM]]), federation is a system of identity management that allows users to access multiple IT systems and applications across different organizations using the same identification data (login credentials). Federation achieves this by standardizing and sharing identity information across disparate security domains, typically using trusted third parties.

## Key Features

- **[[Single Sign-On]] ([[Single Sign-On|SSO]]) Capabilities:** Enables users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems without re-entering credentials.
- **Standards-Based:** Utilizes standard protocols such as SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), OpenID Connect, and OAuth to facilitate secure communications between entities.
- **Identity Providers (IdPs) and Service Providers (SPs):** Involves roles where the IdP authenticates user credentials and the SP relies on the IdP to assert the identity of the user.

## How It Works

Federation operates by having:

1. **Identity Provider (IdP):** This is the system responsible for verifying user identities and providing authentication tokens (assertions).
2. **Service Provider (SP):** This is the application or service requesting the identity verification. It accepts the token from the IdP as proof of authentication.
3. **User:** Initiates access to a service that redirects them to their IdP for authentication. Upon successful authentication, the IdP sends a token back to the SP, which grants the user access.

## Problem Addressed

Federation addresses the complexity and security issues associated with managing multiple identities and passwords across various systems and organizations. It simplifies user access while enhancing security and privacy by minimizing the number of times users must authenticate.

## Implications

Federation facilitates seamless collaboration and resource sharing across organizational boundaries, making it essential for businesses that integrate with third-party services or that operate in multi-enterprise environments.

## Impact

Federation significantly improves user experience by reducing password fatigue and streamlining access processes. For organizations, it reduces the administrative overhead associated with managing user identities and credentials across multiple systems and security domains.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Secure Token Service (STS):** Issues security tokens that contain packaged user credentials.
- **[[Encryption]] and Signing of Assertions:** Ensures that the data within the tokens is secure from tampering and eavesdropping.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Ensures that the federation infrastructure complies with security policies and that all integrations are secure.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Federation can be vulnerable to security risks associated with centralized services, such as the compromise of the IdP, which could potentially affect all connected services. Also, incorrect configuration or implementation of federation protocols can lead to vulnerabilities.

## Common Tools/Software

- **AD FS (Active Directory Federation Services):** A Windows Server role that provides federation capabilities.
- **Shibboleth:** An open-source identity federation solution that supports SAML-based authentication.
- **Ping Identity:** Offers scalable identity federation and [[single sign-on]] solutions for enterprises.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST Special Publication 800-63C,** "Digital Identity Guidelines, Federation and Assertions": Offers guidance on securely implementing federation services.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Provides requirements for an information security management system (ISMS) that includes management of digital identities and federated identity services.

## Best Practices

- Ensure secure communication channels between all federation parties (IdP and SP).
- Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
- Use strong [[encryption]] standards for tokens and ensure that sensitive data within tokens is minimized.

## Current Status

As organizations continue to embrace cloud computing and collaborate across industries, the importance of federation in [[Identity and Access Management|IAM]] is growing. Ongoing developments focus on enhancing the security and efficiency of federation protocols and mechanisms.
