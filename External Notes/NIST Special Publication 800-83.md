# NIST Special Publication 800-83

NIST Special Publication 800-83, titled "Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops," is a guideline developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It provides comprehensive recommendations for preventing, detecting, and responding to [[malware]] incidents specifically targeting desktop and laptop environments.

## Key Features

- **Prevention Strategies:** Outlines best practices for preventing malware infections, such as the use of antivirus software, regular updates, and user training.
- **Detection Techniques:** Provides methods for detecting [[malware]] activities using tools and monitoring systems.
- **Response and Recovery:** Offers a structured approach to responding to [[malware]] incidents, including containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
- **Policy Development:** Assists organizations in developing and implementing policies that support effective [[malware]] management.

## How It Works

The guide provides a step-by-step approach:

1. **Prevention:** Implementing security measures to reduce the risk of malware infection.
2. **Detection:** Monitoring systems and networks for signs of malware activity.
3. **Analysis:** Determining the type, scope, and impact of the malware infection.
4. **Containment:** Isolating affected systems to prevent further spread.
5. **Eradication:** Removing the malware from all infected systems.
6. **Recovery:** Restoring systems to normal operations and confirming that they are no longer compromised.
7. **Post-Incident Review:** Evaluating the response and updating policies and defenses based on lessons learned.

## Common Techniques

- **Regular Software Updates:** Ensuring that all systems and applications are up-to-date to minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Antivirus and Anti-malware Tools:** Deploying and regularly updating these tools across all endpoints.
- **Network Segmentation:** Limiting malware spread by segmenting networks into smaller, controlled zones.
- **User Education:** Training users on how to recognize phishing attempts and other common malware delivery methods.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Security Posture:** Helps organizations strengthen their defenses against malware.
- **Reduced Incident Impact:** Effective strategies for incident handling reduce the duration and impact of malware infections.
- **Improved Recovery Time:** Structured recovery processes help return operations to normal more quickly after an incident.
- **Compliance Support:** Assists in meeting compliance requirements related to cybersecurity incident management.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-53|NIST SP 800-53]],** "Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations": Provides a broader set of security controls that include malware defense strategies.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Offers guidelines on establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system, which complements the malware-specific strategies in SP 800-83.
- **Cybersecurity Framework:** Developed by NIST to provide a high-level taxonomy of cybersecurity outcomes and a methodology to assess and manage those outcomes.

## Best Practices

- Implement layered security controls as no single method is sufficient to protect against all types of malware.
- Regularly update and patch systems to close vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware.
- Conduct routine backups of critical data to facilitate recovery in the event of a malware attack.
- Perform regular audits and simulations to test the effectiveness of existing malware defense and response strategies.

## Current Status

As malware continues to evolve in complexity and sophistication, guidelines like NIST SP 800-83 are periodically reviewed and updated to include new technologies, tactics, and recovery techniques that address current cybersecurity challenges.
