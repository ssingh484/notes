# Digital Signatures

Digital signatures are a cryptographic mechanism used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. A digital signature confirms that a document or message was sent by the verified sender and has not been altered in transit.

## How It Works

Digital signatures utilize [[Asymmetric Encryption|asymmetric cryptography]]. The process involves:

1. **Creating a Hash of the Message:** The original message is hashed using a [[Hash Function|cryptographic hash function]], producing a fixed-size string of bytes.
2. **Signing the Hash:** The hash is encrypted with the sender's [[private key]]. This encrypted hash, along with the hashing algorithm, constitutes the digital signature.
3. **Verification:** The recipient decrypts the signature using the senderâ€™s [[public key]], which should reveal the original hash if unchanged. The recipient then hashes the received message using the same [[hash function]] and compares this hash to the decrypted hash. If they match, it confirms both the integrity and authenticity of the message.

## Key Features

- **Authenticity:** Ensures that the message or document comes from the declared source.
- **Integrity:** Verifies that the content has not been changed since it was signed.
- **Non-repudiation:** Prevents the sender from denying the authorship or sending of the message.

## Problem Addressed

Digital signatures address the challenge of tampering and impersonation in digital communications, ensuring that the contents of a message or document can be trusted and are legally binding.

## Implications

The use of digital signatures is crucial for electronic documents and transactions that require high levels of trust and security, such as legal contracts, financial transactions, and software distribution.

## Impact

Digital signatures significantly enhance the security of electronic transactions by providing a reliable method of confirming the legitimacy of digital communications. They are essential for electronic commerce and the legal validity of digital documents.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Certificate Authorities (CA):** A trusted third party that issues digital certificates used to create digital signatures, which contain the [[public key]] and the identity of the holder.
- **Timestamping:** Ensures that digital signatures are valid even if the signing key is compromised or expired after the time of signing.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Digital signatures are generally secure, but their strength depends on the underlying [[encryption]] algorithm and key size. Weak or compromised private keys, poor implementation, and insecure certificate authorities can undermine the security of digital signatures.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Adobe Sign:** Allows users to securely sign and manage documents electronically.
- **DocuSign:** A platform that provides electronic signature technology and digital transaction management.
- **Microsoft Envelope:** Integrates digital signatures into Microsoft Office documents.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **eIDAS Regulation (EU):** Establishes standards for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Union, including digital signatures.
- **Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN, U.S.):** Provides legal recognition of electronic signatures in interstate and international commerce.
- **NIST Special Publications:** Provide guidelines for implementing digital signature algorithms, such as [[NIST Special Publication 800-63|NIST SP 800-63]].

## Best Practices

- Use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and sufficiently long keys.
- Secure the [[private key]] using hardware security modules (HSMs) or other secure storage mechanisms.
- Ensure certificates are obtained from a reputable certificate authority.
- Regularly update and review the security policies related to digital signatures and their management.

## Current Status

Digital signatures continue to evolve with advances in [[cryptography]] and security practices. The development of [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)]] aims to prepare digital signature algorithms for the era of [[quantum computing]].
