# WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

**Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)** is a security protocol for wireless networks that was designed to provide a comparable level of security to that of a wired LAN. Introduced in 1997 as part of the original 802.11 standard, WEP was the first [[encryption]] scheme available for wireless networks, intended to protect data through [[encryption]] over radio waves.

## Key Features

- **[[Encryption]] Method:** Uses the RC4 [[encryption]] [[algorithm]] to encrypt data transmitted over the wireless network.
- **Authentication:** Provides basic authentication options to control access to the network.
- **Configuration Simplicity:** Designed to be relatively easy to configure and use, requiring minimal user intervention.

## Problem Addressed

WEP was developed to address the need for:

- **Data Confidentiality:** Protect data from being read by unauthorized parties.
- **Access Control:** Prevent unauthorized access to the network.

## Implications

- **Initial Security Provision:** Offered the first step towards securing early wireless networks, setting a foundation for future security developments.
- **Limited Security:** Known for its vulnerabilities and limited by relatively weak [[encryption]] standards.

## Impact

- **Security Enhancements Over Time:** Prompted the development of more robust security measures as its weaknesses became apparent.
- **Baseline for Improvements:** Served as a stepping stone for the introduction of more secure protocols like WPA and WPA2.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Upgrade Recommendations:** Due to its vulnerabilities, the best defense against WEP’s weaknesses is to upgrade to more secure [[encryption]] methods like WPA2 or WPA3.
- **Supplemental Security Measures:** Implementing additional layers of security, such as [[Virtual Private Networks|VPNs]], to protect data transmitted over networks originally secured by WEP.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- [[WEP Cracking]]
- **Key Management and Size:** WEP uses static keys that are often too short, making it vulnerable to multiple attack vectors, including brute force attacks.
- **IV Collision:** The protocol’s use of a small initialization vector (IV) leads to repeated use of the same [[encryption]] keys, making it susceptible to related-key attacks.

## Common Tools/Software

- **[[Aircrack-ng]]:** Widely used for testing [[network security]], including cracking WEP [[encryption]].
- **[[Wireshark]]:** Can analyze WEP-encrypted packets to detect vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.

## Current Status

- **Widely Deprecated:** Due to its significant security flaws, WEP is deprecated and no longer recommended for use in any secure environment.
- **Historical Relevance:** Continues to be studied in cybersecurity education as a case study in the evolution of [[wireless security]] protocols.
