### Stage Blue (Spiral Dynamics)

**Overview of Spiral Dynamics:** Spiral Dynamics is a psychological model that outlines the evolution of human consciousness through eight colored stages: Beige, Purple, Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow, and Turquoise. Each stage represents a set of values and worldviews that influence both individual and collective human behavior. Understanding these stages helps us navigate and tolerate the diverse perspectives and levels of development within society.

**Stage Blue - The Essence:** Stage Blue, known as the absolutist conformist rule, is characterized by a strong emphasis on obedience to authority and the rise of civilization through organized principles and structured systems.
