# NIST Special Publication 800-63

NIST Special Publication 800-63 is a set of guidelines for digital identity management, published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It provides comprehensive recommendations for the registration and authentication of users in digital systems across governmental and commercial platforms.

## Key Features

- **Digital Identity Model:** Categorizes identity assurance into three components: identity proofing (IAL), authenticator assurance (AAL), and federation assurance (FAL).
- **Risk Assessment:** Tailors identity proofing and authentication requirements based on the assessed risks of various types of transactions.
- **Authentication and Lifecycle Management:** Details technical requirements and best practices for managing the lifecycle of digital identities.

## How It Works

NIST SP 800-63 outlines processes and procedures for securely managing digital identities. It breaks down the assurance levels required for different services:
- **Identity Assurance Levels (IAL):** Concerned with the identity proofing process and ensuring that the identity claimed is associated with the real user.
- **Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL):** Focuses on the robustness of the authentication process, ranging from simple passwords to multi-factor authentication mechanisms.
- **Federation Assurance Levels (FAL):** Pertains to the assertion process in a federated identity system, including how information is conveyed between providers and relying parties.

## Problem Addressed

The guidelines aim to address the challenges associated with digital identity verification, ensuring that systems can reliably assert the identity of users while maintaining security, privacy, and interoperability.

## Implications

Following these guidelines helps organizations enhance the security and reliability of their digital identity systems. This is crucial for preventing identity theft, fraud, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Impact

NIST SP 800-63 has had a profound impact on how organizations manage digital identities, offering a structured approach that enhances both security and user experience across digital platforms.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):** Requires multiple forms of verification before granting access to ensure higher security.
- **Identity Proofing:** Ensures that the identity presented by a user is verified with high confidence.
- **Continuous Authentication:** Monitors and re-verifies the user’s identity continuously during a session.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Challenges remain in balancing user convenience with security requirements, especially in high-risk environments. Inadequate implementation of these guidelines can lead to vulnerabilities where digital identities may be compromised.

## Common Tools/Software

- **[[Identity and Access Management]] ([[Identity and Access Management|IAM]]) Solutions:** Products from vendors like Okta, Microsoft, and IBM that incorporate NIST SP 800-63 guidelines into their [[Identity and Access Management|IAM]] frameworks.
- **MFA Tools:** Solutions such as Google Authenticator, [[External Notes/RSA]] SecurID, and Duo Security that provide robust multi-factor authentication capabilities in line with NIST recommendations.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Provides standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risk, complementing the identity management aspects of NIST SP 800-63.
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]]):** Ensures that identity data management practices comply with privacy and protection standards applicable primarily in the European Union.

## Best Practices

- Ensure thorough and ongoing training for stakeholders on the importance and implementation of strong digital identity verification measures.
- Regularly review and update digital identity practices to align with the latest NIST SP 800-63 revisions and emerging security technologies.
- Implement layered security measures, combining both physical and digital authentication methods to safeguard user identities.
