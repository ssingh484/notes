# Code-Based Cryptography

Code-based cryptography is a type of cryptographic method that relies on error-correcting codes to secure communications. As part of [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)]], it is designed to be secure against attacks from both classical and [[Quantum Computing|quantum computers]], making it a candidate for securing cryptographic functions in a future where [[quantum computing]] is prevalent.

## How It Works

Code-based cryptography typically involves constructing a scenario where decoding a randomly chosen code is computationally hard, except for parties who possess a secret decoding [[algorithm]]. The most well-known code-based algorithm is the McEliece cryptosystem, which uses a specific class of error-correcting codes known as Goppa codes. Here's a simplified explanation:

- **Key Generation:** Generate a public and a [[private key]] using error-correcting codes, where the [[private key]] is a secret error-correcting code.
- **[[Encryption]]:** Use the [[public key]] to introduce errors into a plaintext message, essentially encoding it.
- **Decryption:** Apply the [[private key]]'s error-correcting code to decode the message and correct the errors, revealing the original plaintext.

## Key Features

- **Resistance to Quantum Attacks:** Utilizes mathematical problems that are currently believed to be resistant to both classical and [[quantum computing]] attacks.
- **Error-Correcting Codes:** Leverages the robustness of error-correcting codes to secure communications, which inherently provides a method to correct errors in transmissionsâ€”a useful property for cryptographic resilience.

## Advantages

- **Quantum Resilience:** Offers a secure method of [[encryption]] that is not vulnerable to known [[quantum computing]] [[Algorithm|algorithms]], such as [[Shor's algorithm]].
- **High Security Level:** Provides strong security assurances based on the hardness of decoding random linear codes, which is a well-studied problem.
- **Efficiency:** While key sizes are typically large, the actual encryption and decryption processes can be efficient.

## Major Tools and Software

- **Open Quantum Safe (OQS):** Provides open-source libraries to prototype [[quantum-resistant]] cryptography, including implementations of code-based [[cryptographic algorithms]].
- **liboqs:** A C library that includes support for various [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)|PQC]] algorithms, including code-based schemes.
- **PQClean:** A project that provides clean, portable, and easy-to-use implementations of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, with several code-based options available.
