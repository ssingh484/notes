# CRYSTALS-Dilithium

CRYSTALS-Dilithium is a post-quantum cryptographic [[algorithm]] particularly known for [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]]. Part of the CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) framework, it's based on the hardness of the Ring Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) problem and its variants. Recognized for its efficiency and robustness, it has been a notable contender in the NIST [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)]] standardization project.

## Key Concepts
