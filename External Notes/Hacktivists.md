# Hacktivists

Hacktivists are individuals or groups who use [[hacking]] techniques to promote a political agenda, social change, or ideological beliefs. Their activities are typically aimed at drawing public attention to a cause, protesting against organizations or governments, or revealing information they consider to be ethically important to disclose.

## Key Features

- **Ideologically Driven:** Unlike cybercriminals who are motivated by profit, hacktivists are motivated by political or social objectives.
- **Publicity-Focused:** Often publicize their attacks to gain attention for their cause and to influence public opinion.
- **Targeted Attacks:** Specifically target organizations, governments, or individuals that they believe contradict their ethical or political views.

## How It Works

- **Website Defacement:** Altering the appearance of a website to make a political statement.
- **Denial-of-Service Attacks:** Overloading a service with requests to make it unavailable, often to protest or make a statement against the target organization.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive information to expose alleged misconduct or unethical behavior.

## Advantages

- **Awareness and Advocacy:** Can effectively raise awareness and stimulate debate around specific social or political issues.
- **Pressure and Influence:** May exert pressure on organizations or governments to change policies or practices that are seen as unjust or harmful.

## Major Tools Used

- **LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon):** A popular tool used for [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)|DDoS]] attacks.
- **[[Anonymity|Anonymous]] Proxy Tools:** Used to hide the identity of the attackers.
- **Website Vulnerability Scanning Tools:** To find and exploit vulnerabilities in websites.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)|Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] ([[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)|CFAA]]):** In the United States, this law covers many of the activities undertaken by hacktivists, such as unauthorized access or [[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)|DDoS]] attacks.
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]]):** In the European Union, hacktivists handling personal data during their activities could fall afoul of [[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] provisions.

## Best Practices

- **Ethical Considerations:** It's important for activists to consider the ethical implications of their actions, including the potential harm to innocent bystanders or the legality of their actions.
- **Security Awareness:** Organizations should increase their cybersecurity awareness and preparedness to protect against hacktivist attacks.
- **Legal Channels:** Advocates for change should seek to use legal avenues to effect change where possible, rather than resorting to illegal activities.

## Current Status

As the digital landscape evolves, so does the nature of hacktivism. The tools and techniques are becoming more sophisticated, and as a result, the line between hacktivism and cyberterrorism can sometimes blur, leading to intense legal and ethical debates.
