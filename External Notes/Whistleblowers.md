# Whistleblowers

Whistleblowers are individuals who expose information or activities within a private, public, or government organization that are deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct. The act of whistleblowing can occur internally within the organization or externally to regulators, law enforcement agencies, the media, or other external entities.

## Key Features

- **Exposure of Misconduct:** Whistleblowers report actions within their organization that may be illegal, unsafe, or against the public interest.
- **Risks and Retaliation:** Whistleblowers often face significant personal and professional risks, including retaliation, dismissal, and legal action.
- **Protection Under Law:** Many jurisdictions have laws to protect whistleblowers from retaliation, though the effectiveness and enforcement of these laws can vary widely.

## How It Works

- **Internal Reporting:** Whistleblowers may first report their concerns through internal channels provided by their employer, such as to a supervisor or through an ethics hotline.
- **External Reporting:** If internal reporting is ineffective, or if the whistleblower believes it is not safe or appropriate, they may go to external bodies like regulatory agencies, watchdog organizations, or the media.

## Advantages

- **Promoting Transparency:** Whistleblowing can lead to increased transparency in organizations and government bodies.
- **Deterring Misconduct:** The potential for whistleblowing can serve as a deterrent against unethical behavior within organizations.
- **Supporting Justice and Public Interest:** Whistleblowers can play a critical role in uncovering and stopping practices that harm the public interest.

## Major Tools Used

- **Secure Communication Platforms:** Tools like SecureDrop and Signal are used by whistleblowers to communicate securely and anonymously.
- **Document Leaking Platforms:** Websites that allow for [[Anonymity|anonymous]] submission of documents, such as WikiLeaks.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **Whistleblower Protection Acts:** Various national laws, such as the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)|Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in the U.S., provide protection to whistleblowers, especially in public companies.
- **EU Whistleblowing Directive:** Aims to protect whistleblowers across the European Union, requiring member states to establish safe channels for reporting and measures to protect whistleblowers from retaliation.
- **Public Interest Disclosure Act (PIDA):** In the UK, this act protects employees who make disclosures of certain types of information in the public interest.

## Best Practices

- **Confidentiality:** Maintaining strict confidentiality is crucial to protect whistleblowers from retaliation.
- **Legal Advice:** Whistleblowers should seek legal advice to understand their rights and the protections available to them under the law.
- **Use of Secure Channels:** Using encrypted and secure channels for communication to protect the identity and safety of the whistleblower.

## Current Status

The role and protection of whistleblowers continue to evolve, driven by high-profile cases and changes in public policy. Technological advancements have made it easier for whistleblowers to share information securely, though they also face increased risks of [[surveillance]] and tracking.
