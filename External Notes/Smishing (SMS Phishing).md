# [[Smishing (SMS Phishing)]]

Smishing, or SMS [[phishing]], is a [[Social Engineering Techniques|social engineering]] tactic where attackers use text messages to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information, downloading [[malware]], or clicking on malicious links. Smishing leverages the trust and immediacy of SMS communication to exploit targets.

## Key Features

- **Text Message Communication:** Uses SMS as the primary medium for the attack.
- **Impersonation:** Attackers often pose as trusted entities or individuals.
- **Urgency and Fear:** Creates a sense of urgency or fear to prompt immediate action.
- **Malicious Links:** Often includes links to [[phishing]] websites or prompts to download [[malware]].

## Problem Addressed

Smishing aims to bypass traditional security measures by exploiting the trust and familiarity of SMS communication. It can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and financial fraud.

## Implications

- **Security Breach:** Can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or systems.
- **Identity Theft:** Facilitates the theft of personal or corporate identities.
- **Financial Fraud:** Can result in significant financial losses.
- **Operational Disruption:** May lead to significant disruptions in business operations.

## Impact

- **Loss of Trust:** Erodes trust in SMS-based communications and verification processes.
- **Financial and Data Loss:** Can cause substantial financial losses and data breaches.
- **Reputation Damage:** Organizations may suffer reputational damage if smishing leads to publicized security failures.
- **Regulatory Consequences:** Potential legal and regulatory repercussions for failing to protect against such attacks.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Employee Training:** Regularly educate employees about smishing tactics and how to recognize and respond to them.
- **Message Verification:** Implement processes to verify the authenticity of SMS messages before responding or clicking on links.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Use MFA to add an additional layer of security beyond just SMS verification.
- **Incident Reporting:** Encourage a culture of reporting suspicious text messages and potential smishing attempts.
- **Awareness Programs:** Develop ongoing security awareness programs to keep smishing threats top of mind.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Trust in SMS Communication:** Relies on the trust individuals place in SMS communication.
- **Lack of Awareness:** Takes advantage of targets who are unaware of smishing tactics.
- **Inadequate Verification:** Exploits weak or non-existent verification processes.
- **Mobile Device Vulnerabilities:** Uses mobile device vulnerabilities to install [[malware]] or steal information.

## Common Tools/Techniques

- **Spoofed Sender IDs:** Manipulating the sender ID to make the message appear as if itâ€™s coming from a trusted source.
- **Malicious Links:** Including links to [[phishing]] websites or malicious downloads.
- **Social Engineering Scripts:** Crafting convincing scripts to manipulate the target into providing information or clicking on links.
- **Urgent Messages:** Creating a sense of urgency to prompt immediate action, such as fake account alerts or urgent payment requests.

## Best Practices

- **Continuous Education:** Conduct regular training sessions to keep employees and individuals aware of the risks and signs of smishing.
- **Verification Processes:** Implement strict protocols for verifying the authenticity of SMS messages before responding.
- **MFA Enforcement:** Implement and enforce multi-factor authentication for accessing sensitive systems and information.
- **Clear Policies:** Establish and communicate clear policies for handling SMS-based requests for sensitive information.
- **Regular Audits:** Perform regular audits of SMS communication practices and security measures.
- **Incident Reporting:** Encourage a culture of reporting any suspicious text messages or potential smishing attempts.

## Current Status

Smishing remains a significant threat due to its reliance on the trust and immediacy of SMS communication. Continuous education, robust verification processes, and a vigilant security culture are essential to mitigate these threats.
