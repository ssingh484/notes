# Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a type of cyberattack where an attacker intercepts and potentially alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge. The attacker secretly relays and possibly modifies the communication between the sender and receiver, often to steal sensitive information or inject malicious content.

## Key Features

- **Interception**: The attacker intercepts the communication between two parties, typically by positioning themselves between the victim and the resource they are trying to access.
- **Eavesdropping**: The attacker can silently monitor and capture the data being exchanged, which may include sensitive information such as login credentials, personal data, and financial information.
- **Data Manipulation**: Beyond simply intercepting data, attackers can also alter the communication, such as injecting malicious content or redirecting the user to a fake website.
- **Session Hijacking**: In some cases, attackers can take over an active session, impersonating one of the parties to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.
- **Spoofing**: Attackers often use techniques like DNS spoofing, ARP spoofing, or SSL stripping to carry out MitM attacks.

## Problem Addressed

MitM attacks target the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of communications between parties. They exploit the trust between the communicating entities, allowing attackers to steal information, impersonate users, or manipulate communications.

## Implications

MitM attacks pose significant risks to the security and privacy of communications. They can lead to data breaches, financial loss, identity theft, and unauthorized access to sensitive systems. Such attacks can also undermine trust in online services, especially if they are used to compromise secure transactions or communications.

## Impact

- **Data Breaches**: Sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, and personal data can be stolen and used for fraudulent activities.
- **Financial Loss**: Attackers can use intercepted information to steal money directly or gain access to accounts to carry out unauthorized transactions.
- **Reputation Damage**: Companies whose communications are compromised may suffer from loss of customer trust and damage to their brand reputation.
- **Legal Consequences**: Organizations may face legal action if they fail to protect user data from MitM attacks, especially in regulated industries.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **[[Encryption]]**: Using strong [[encryption]] protocols like TLS/SSL for all communications ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be easily read by attackers.
- **[[Virtual Private Networks|VPNs]]**: Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) create secure tunnels for data transmission, protecting against interception on unsecured networks.
- **[[Public Key Infrastructure]] (PKI)**: [[Public Key Infrastructure|PKI]] uses digital certificates to authenticate the identities of the parties involved in communication, ensuring that data is sent and received from the intended source.
- **[[DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)]]**: DNSSEC helps to protect against [[DNS spoofing]] by ensuring that the DNS responses have not been tampered with.
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolating sensitive systems and networks reduces the attack surface available to potential MitM attackers.
- **User Awareness**: Educating users about the risks of MitM attacks, such as avoiding unsecured Wi-Fi networks and verifying website security certificates, can help prevent such attacks.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Unsecured Networks**: Public Wi-Fi networks are common targets for MitM attacks, as they are often unencrypted and lack security measures.
- **Weak [[Encryption]]**: Using outdated or weak [[encryption]] protocols can make it easier for attackers to decrypt intercepted communications.
- **SSL Stripping**: Attackers can downgrade HTTPS connections to HTTP, intercepting data that should have been encrypted.
- **DNS and [[ARP Spoofing]]**: By altering DNS or ARP entries, attackers can redirect traffic to malicious servers or their own devices.

## Common Tools/Software

- **[[Wireshark]]**: A network protocol analyzer used to capture and analyze network traffic, which can be used to detect MitM attacks.
- **Ettercap**: A comprehensive suite for man-in-the-middle attacks on LAN, including support for active and passive dissection of many protocols.
- **Cain & Abel**: A password recovery tool for Windows that can be used for ARP spoofing, allowing attackers to intercept and modify network traffic.
- **BetterCAP**: A powerful, flexible tool for network attack and monitoring, including man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Current Status

MitM attacks remain a prevalent threat, particularly as more communications move online. Despite the widespread adoption of HTTPS and other security measures, attackers continue to find ways to exploit weaknesses in network configurations, user behavior, and outdated [[encryption]] standards. Ongoing efforts to improve [[encryption]], user education, and secure communication practices are critical in combating this threat.
