# Wifite

Wifite is a powerful, automated tool designed for auditing and attacking multiple [[Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)|WEP]] and [[Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)|WPA]] encrypted wireless networks simultaneously. It simplifies the process by integrating several existing wireless auditing tools to conduct comprehensive attacks efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Automation:** Runs with minimal user input and can operate without supervision.
- **Multi-Target Capability:** Capable of attacking multiple networks at once.
- **Integration:** Uses tools such as airmon-ng, [[aircrack-ng]], [[aireplay-ng]], [[airodump-ng]], and packetforge-ng.
- **Customization:** Highly customizable with a few arguments to tailor the attack process.
- **Ease of Use:** Designed to be a "set it and forget it" tool for wireless auditing.

## Problem Addressed

Wifite addresses the need for a streamlined, automated process for auditing wireless networks. It reduces the complexity and time required for manual wireless attacks, making it accessible to both beginners and advanced users in the cybersecurity field.

## Implications

Wifite's automation of complex wireless attacks highlights the importance of securing wireless networks against such threats. It demonstrates that even automated tools can perform sophisticated attacks, underscoring the need for robust security measures.

## Impact

Wifite significantly impacts the cybersecurity landscape by:
- Reducing the time and effort needed for wireless [[network security]] audits.
- Making wireless network testing accessible to a broader audience.
- Highlighting vulnerabilities in wireless [[network security]], thereby encouraging better security practices.

## Defense Mechanisms

To protect against attacks from tools like Wifite:
- **Strong [[Encryption]]:** Use WPA3 or the latest [[Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)|WPA2]] encryption standards.
- **Disable WPS:** Turn off Wi-Fi Protected Setup to prevent exploitation.
- **Regular Monitoring:** Continuously monitor network activity to detect unauthorized attempts.
- **Complex Passwords:** Use strong, unique passwords for your wireless networks.
- **Firmware Updates:** Keep your router and network devices updated with the latest firmware.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Weak Passwords:** Networks with weak or default passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
- **WPS Enabled:** Networks with WPS enabled can be easily exploited by tools like Reaver.
- **Outdated [[Encryption]]:** Networks using outdated [[Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)|WEP]] encryption are highly susceptible to attacks.
- **Poor Monitoring:** Lack of regular network monitoring can allow unauthorized access to go undetected.

## Common Tools/Software

Wifite utilizes the following tools to conduct its attacks:
- **airmon-ng:** Enables [[Change MAC from Managed to Monitor Mode|monitor mode]] on wireless interfaces.
- **aircrack-ng:** Cracks WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK keys.
- **aireplay-ng:** Performs deauthentication attacks and various other WEP attacks.
- **airodump-ng:** Captures raw 802.11 frames and collects WEP IVs.
- **packetforge-ng:** Creates encrypted packets for injection.
- **Reaver:** Attacks routers with WPS enabled.
- **Pyrit:** Benchmarks CPU speeds and cracks WPA/WPA2 passwords using GPU power.
- **Tshark:** Captures and analyzes network packets.
- **Cowpatty:** Conducts offline dictionary attacks against WPA/WPA2 networks.
- **Pixiewps:** Performs offline bruteforce attacks on WPS pins.
