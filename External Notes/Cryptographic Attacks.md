# Cryptographic Attacks

Cryptographic attacks refer to methods and techniques used to compromise the integrity and effectiveness of cryptographic systems and protocols. These attacks aim to decrypt encrypted data, forge [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]], or retrieve secret keys without authorization, often exploiting weaknesses in [[cryptographic algorithms]], implementations, or key management practices.

## How It Works

Cryptographic attacks generally exploit vulnerabilities in the design of [[cryptographic algorithms]], the way they are implemented, or how keys are managed. Attackers may use various techniques to gain unauthorized access to encrypted data or to break [[encryption]] without the need for the decryption key.

## Key Features

- **Exploitation of Weaknesses:** Targets inherent flaws or implementation errors in cryptographic systems.
- **Key Recovery:** Attempts to recover [[encryption]] keys using methods like brute force or [[algorithm]] vulnerabilities.
- **Decryption of Ciphertext:** Seeks to decrypt messages without access to the decryption key, using techniques such as side-channel attacks or [[cryptanalysis]].

## Common Techniques

- **Brute Force Attack:** Involves systematically checking all possible keys until the correct key is found.
- **Side-Channel Attack:** Exploits physical implementation flaws in a crypto system, such as timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks, or even sounds to extract cryptographic keys.
- **Frequency Analysis:** Used primarily against classical ciphers, this technique analyzes the frequency of elements in the encrypted text to deduce a likely plaintext.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack ([[Man-in-the-middle attacks|MITM]]):** Intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.
- **Chosen Plaintext Attack:** The attacker gains the ciphertexts corresponding to a set of plaintexts of their own choosing.
- **Rainbow Table Attack:** Uses precomputed tables of hash values to reverse [[Hash Function|cryptographic hash functions]], commonly used in password cracking.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST Special Publications (e.g., [[NIST Special Publication 800-175B]]):** Guide on cryptographic key management, providing recommendations to prevent cryptographic attacks by ensuring strong key generation, storage, and destruction practices.
- **[[ISOIEC 27002]]:** Provides guidelines for organizational information security standards, including the management of cryptographic techniques and the mitigation of cryptographic risks.
- **[[FIPS 140-2]]:** Standards for cryptographic modules, including requirements for physical security and cryptographic key management to protect against cryptographic attacks.

## Implications

Cryptographic attacks can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, financial losses, and damage to the reputation of impacted organizations. They challenge the trustworthiness of encrypted communications and stored data, highlighting the need for robust cryptographic standards and continuous security evaluation.

## Best Practices

- Use strong, well-vetted [[cryptographic algorithms]] and large key sizes to resist attacks.
- Regularly update and patch cryptographic libraries and systems to protect against known vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper key management practices to prevent unauthorized access to cryptographic keys.
- Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to detect and mitigate potential cryptographic weaknesses.

## Current Status

As computing power increases and new computational techniques are developed, cryptographic attacks are becoming more sophisticated. Ongoing research and development in [[quantum computing]] also pose future threats to current [[cryptographic protocols]], prompting advancements in [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)]].
