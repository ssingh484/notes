### ARP Request Replay Attack

This step involves capturing and replaying ARP packets to induce the Access Point (AP) to generate more packets with new Initialization Vectors (IVs), which are essential for cracking the WEP key. This method is carried out after successfully performing a fake authentication attack.

#### Pre-requisites:
- Ensure you have completed a fake authentication attack.
- Keep all three Terminator windows open from the previous steps.

#### Instructions:

**1. Prepare for ARP Replay**
   - In the **second Terminator window** (where you previously performed the fake authentication), copy and paste the following command to ensure the fake authentication session is still active:
     ```bash
     sudo aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a 64:16:F0:EC:7B:F3 -h 48:5D:60:2A:45:25 mon0
     ```
   - Do not press enter yet; just prepare the command.

**2. Set Up ARP Request Replay**
   - Switch to the **third Terminator window**.
   - Clear previous outputs to avoid confusion by typing:
     ```bash
     clear
     ```
   - Modify and prepare the ARP replay attack command by copying the previously used command and changing it to:
     ```bash
     sudo aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b 64:16:F0:EC:7B:F3 -h 48:5D:60:2A:45:25 mon0
     ```
   - Execute the command. This step involves capturing an ARP request and then continuously replaying it to generate more data packets with new IVs.

**3. Maintain Association with the AP**
   - Return to the **second Terminator window**.
   - Re-run the fake authentication command to maintain your association with the AP. Press enter to execute:
     ```bash
     sudo aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a 64:16:F0:EC:7B:F3 -h 48:5D:60:2A:45:25 mon0
     ```

**4. Start Cracking the WEP Key**
   - Once you have accumulated enough IVs, you can attempt to crack the WEP key.
   - In any window, initiate the cracking process using:
     ```bash
     sudo aircrack-ng arpreplay-01.cap
     ```
   - Replace `arpreplay-01.cap` with the actual name of the capture file containing the IVs, if it is different.

By following these steps, you are replaying ARP requests to generate sufficient data required to crack the WEP key. Be patient as gathering enough IVs can take some time depending on network traffic and the responsiveness of the AP.
