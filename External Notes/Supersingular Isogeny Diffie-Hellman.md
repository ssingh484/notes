# Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH)

Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) is a cryptographic algorithm that belongs to the family of [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)|post-quantum cryptography]]. It relies on the mathematical structure of elliptic curves and their [[isogenies]] to facilitate secure key exchanges. SIDH is designed to be resistant to attacks by [[Quantum Computing|quantum computers]], which can break many of the traditional cryptographic systems.

## How It Works

- **Key Generation:** Each party generates a pair of public and private keys based on a supersingular [[Elliptic Curve Cryptography|elliptic curve]] and a chosen [[Isogenies|isogeny]]. The [[private key]] is a secret [[Isogenies|isogeny]], and the [[public key]] is the image of this [[Isogenies|isogeny]].
- **Key Exchange:** Two parties exchange their public keys and combine them with their respective private keys to compute a shared secret. The security of SIDH comes from the difficulty of determining the composition of [[isogenies]] from the public information.
- **Shared Secret:** This shared secret, derived independently by each party using their [[private key]] and the other party's [[public key]], is then used to encrypt further communications using [[symmetric cryptography]].

## Problem Addressed

SIDH addresses the vulnerability of traditional [[cryptographic algorithms]] (like [[External Notes/RSA]] and [[Elliptic Curve Cryptography|ECC]]) to quantum attacks. It provides a mechanism for secure key exchange even in the presence of [[Quantum Computing|quantum computers]], ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of communications.

## Implications

The development and implementation of SIDH are crucial for preparing cybersecurity infrastructures for the post-quantum era, where traditional [[encryption]] methods may no longer be secure against quantum attacks.

## Impact

SIDH contributes to the evolution of [[encryption]] practices, offering a [[quantum-resistant]] algorithm that can be integrated into existing systems to enhance their security against future threats.

## Advantages

- **[[Quantum-Resistant|Quantum Resistance]]:** SIDH is not vulnerable to known [[quantum computing]] attacks, such as [[Shor's algorithm]], which can break [[External Notes/RSA]] and [[Elliptic Curve Cryptography|ECC]].
- **Forward Secrecy:** Like other [[Diffie-Hellman]] methods, SIDH supports forward secrecy, ensuring that the compromise of long-term keys does not compromise past session keys.
- **Compatibility:** Can be implemented alongside existing [[cryptographic protocols]], providing a smooth transition to [[quantum-resistant]] methodologies.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

While SIDH is promising, its performance and key size are areas of ongoing research and optimization. Current implementations of SIDH have larger key sizes and slower performance compared to traditional methods, which may limit its usability in certain applications.

## Common Tools/Software

- **SIKE (Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation):** An implementation of SIDH that is part of the [[NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization]] process. SIKE provides tools for integrating SIDH into security protocols.
- **Microsoft Research SIDH Library:** A C library developed by Microsoft Research for implementing SIDH, aimed at experimenting and researching SIDH's applications in cryptographic systems.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization]]:** NIST is actively evaluating SIDH (through SIKE) as part of its initiative to standardize [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)|post-quantum cryptographic algorithms]]. This standardization will guide the adoption of [[quantum-resistant]] [[Algorithm|algorithms]] across various security protocols and industries.
- **Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act:** Encourages the update of existing cryptographic systems with [[quantum-resistant]] [[Algorithm|algorithms]] to secure critical infrastructure against future quantum threats.

## Current Status

SIDH is under active development and research, with its potential role in future cryptographic standards still being evaluated. It represents a significant area of interest in the field of [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)|post-quantum cryptography]].
