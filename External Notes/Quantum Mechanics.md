## Definition

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of modern physics and is essential for understanding the behavior of matter on its smallest scales.

## Key Principles

- **[[Quantum Superposition|Superposition]]**: A quantum system can exist in a combination of multiple states simultaneously until observed.
    
- **Quantization**: Energy is quantized, meaning it exists in discrete units rather than a continuous range.
    
- **[[Quantum Entanglement|Entanglement]]**: Particles can become interconnected and the state of one instantly affects the state of the other, regardless of distance.
    
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Matter exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties.
    
- **[[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle|Uncertainty Principle]]**: Proposed by Werner Heisenberg, it asserts that certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot both be precisely measured simultaneously.
    

## Historical Context

- **Planck's Black Body Radiation**: Max Planck introduced the concept of quantized energy to explain black body radiation.
    
- **Einstein's Photoelectric Effect**: Albert Einstein proposed that light consists of quantized energy packets called photons, supporting the idea of quantized energy levels.
    
- **Schrödinger's Equation**: Erwin Schrödinger developed a wave equation that predicts the probability distribution of a particle's position.
    
- **Bohr's Model of the Atom**: Niels Bohr described atoms with electrons in quantized energy orbits.
    

## Implications

- **[[Quantum Tunneling]]**: Particles can pass through barriers that classical mechanics predicts they shouldn't be able to.
    
- **[[Quantum Computing]]**: Uses principles of [[Quantum Superposition|superposition]] and [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]] to perform calculations at speeds unimaginable with classical computers.
    
- **[[Quantum Cryptography]]**: Leverages quantum properties to develop secure communication protocols.
    

## Challenges & Controversies

- **[[Copenhagen Interpretation]]**: Traditional interpretation that observation collapses a quantum state.
    
- **[[Many-Worlds Interpretation]]**: Every quantum event is a branch point; all possible outcomes happen in separate, non-communicating parallel universes.
    
- **[[Pilot Wave Theory]]**: Proposes that particles are not governed by wave functions but guided by pilot waves.
    

## Current Status

- **Experimental Verifications**: Various phenomena like the [[double-slit experiment]] have confirmed quantum mechanical predictions.
    
- **[[Quantum Field Theory]]**: A framework that extends quantum mechanics to include [[special relativity]], serving as a foundation for particle physics.
    
- **Ongoing Research**: Despite its success, quantum mechanics isn't a complete theory and doesn't integrate with [[general relativity]]. Efforts like [[String Theory]] and [[Loop Quantum Gravity]] seek to address these gaps.
