## Definition

Triple [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] (3DES) is an encryption standard that uses the [[Data Encryption Standard]] ([[Data Encryption Standard|DES]]) cipher [[algorithm]] three times to each data block. It was designed to provide a more secure alternative to the original [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], which became increasingly vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to its shorter key length.

## Overview

- **Encryption Process**: Applies the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] [[algorithm]] three times in a sequence (encrypt-decrypt-encrypt) using two or three unique keys.
- **Key Lengths**:
    - **2-Key 3DES**: Uses two unique 56-bit keys, resulting in an effective key length of 112 bits.
    - **3-Key 3DES**: Uses three unique 56-bit keys, providing an effective key length of 168 bits.

## Evolution & Need

- **Vulnerabilities of [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]]**: With the growth of computational power, [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] became susceptible to brute-force attacks.
- **Transitional Solution**: Before the adoption of the [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]] ([[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]]), 3DES served as an interim solution to bolster [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]]'s diminishing security.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Backward Compatibility**: 3DES is compatible with [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], meaning that a 3DES encryption system can communicate with a [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] system.
2. **Processing Overhead**: Due to its triple encryption nature, 3DES is considerably slower than [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and other modern encryption [[Algorithm|algorithms]].
3. **Security**: While 3DES is significantly more secure than [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], it's still considered less secure than modern standards like [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]].

## Current Status & Recommendations

- **Deprecation**: 3DES is being phased out in many applications in favor of more secure and efficient encryption methods.
- **[[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]] Transition**: The [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]] ([[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]]) has largely replaced 3DES as the preferred [[Symmetric Cryptography|symmetric encryption]] standard.

## Related Concepts

- **[[Data Encryption Standard]] ([[Data Encryption Standard|DES]])**: The predecessor to 3DES, originally adopted in 1977.
- **[[Symmetric Cryptography]]**: A type of [[cryptography]] where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- **[[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]] ([[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]])**: The successor to [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and 3DES, offering enhanced security and performance.
