# API Security

API Security refers to the practices and technologies used to protect application programming interfaces ([[APIs]]) from being exploited. APIs, which allow different software systems to communicate with each other, can expose various business logic and data, making them a focal point for security.

## Key Features

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Ensures that only legitimate users and services can access the API by implementing OAuth, API keys, or other security tokens.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make to the API within a certain period.
- **[[Encryption]]:** Secures data in transit via protocols like HTTPS to prevent interception and tampering.
- **Input Validation:** Protects against malicious data being sent through [[APIs]] by validating all input data against expected formats.

## How It Works

API Security typically involves securing the data transmission between the client and server, authenticating users or services requesting access, and authorizing the operations that users or services are allowed to perform. It also includes monitoring and logging all [[APIs|API]] traffic to detect and respond to potential security threats promptly.

## Problem Addressed

API Security addresses vulnerabilities such as unauthorized data access, data breaches, and denial of service attacks that can compromise the integrity and availability of software systems communicating over [[APIs]].

## Implications

Effective [[APIs|API]] security is critical for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged between services and applications. It is essential for businesses that rely on [[APIs]] to integrate their systems and services, ensuring that their operations are not disrupted by attacks and that they comply with data protection regulations.

## Impact

Robust [[APIs|API]] security measures enhance the security posture of an organization by preventing unauthorized access and data leaks. This protection is crucial for maintaining trust among users and clients, safeguarding sensitive information, and ensuring the continuous availability of services.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **API Gateways:** Serve as a protective layer that manages authentication, monitors traffic, and enforces policies.
- **Threat Detection:** Uses automated tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities in real-time.
- **Security Policies:** Enforces strict security policies to control access and protect against vulnerabilities.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Common vulnerabilities in [[APIs]] include insecure data storage, lack of proper authentication, insufficient logging and monitoring, and failure to implement secure headers. These can lead to various attacks such as injection, broken authentication, and data exposure.

## Common Tools/Software

- **[[OWASP Zap]]:** A security tool that can be used for testing the security of [[APIs]] by identifying vulnerabilities.
- **Postman:** While primarily used for [[APIs|API]] testing, it includes features for ensuring [[APIs|API]] security through testing authorization flows and scripting security tests.
- **APIsec:** Offers automated security testing specifically designed for [[APIs]], identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[OWASP API Security Top 10]]:** Provides a list of the top ten vulnerabilities specifically related to [[APIs|API]] security and offers guidance for mitigation.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001]]:** While more general, this standard's risk management and control guidelines apply to [[APIs|API]] security, ensuring that data handled by [[APIs]] remains secure.
- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-53]]:** Recommends security controls for federal information systems that include [[APIs]], ensuring their security through rigorous management and protection measures.

## Best Practices

- Continuously monitor [[APIs|API]] activity to detect and respond to anomalies quickly.
- Implement strong authentication and authorization measures to control access to [[APIs]].
- Regularly update and patch [[APIs|API]]-related software and dependencies to protect against known vulnerabilities.

## Current Status

As [[APIs|API]] usage grows with the expansion of cloud services and IoT devices, [[APIs|API]] security continues to be a dynamic field. There is an increasing focus on developing more sophisticated security solutions to protect [[APIs]] from [[emerging threats]].
