# WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II)

**Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)** is the second generation of [[Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)|Wi-Fi Protected Access]] security protocol and security certification program developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance. Introduced in 2004, WPA2 is the successor to [[Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)|WPA]] and is designed to provide more secure wireless network [[encryption]] by using the [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]].

## Key Features

- **[[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]]:** WPA2 uses [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]], a more robust [[encryption]] protocol, to secure wireless data transmission.
- **Mandatory in New Devices:** As of 2006, WPA2 certification is mandatory for all new devices wanting to bear the Wi-Fi trademark.
- **Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and Enterprise Modes:** Similar to [[Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)|WPA]], WPA2 offers both a Personal mode (WPA2-PSK) and an Enterprise mode (WPA2-Enterprise) for different use cases.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Compatible with [[Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)|WPA]], allowing mixed-mode implementations.

## Problem Addressed

WPA2 addresses the security limitations of [[Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)|WPA]], specifically:

- **Enhanced Security:** Provides stronger, more reliable protection to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **[[Encryption]] Vulnerabilities:** Addresses vulnerabilities associated with [[Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)|WPA]]â€™s TKIP by implementing the more secure [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]] [[encryption]].

## Implications

- **Stronger [[Network Security]]:** Significantly reduces the risks associated with wireless communication, protecting against attacks such as decryption and data manipulation.
- **Broad Adoption:** Became the industry standard for wireless [[network security]], ensuring widespread adoption across devices and networks.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Helps organizations meet regulatory requirements for data security, particularly in sensitive industries.

## Impact

- **Improved Data Protection:** Ensures that data transmitted over Wi-Fi networks is well protected against eavesdropping and tampering.
- **Confidence in Wireless Technology:** Increases user and enterprise confidence in the security of wireless networks, promoting greater adoption and reliance on wireless technology.
- **Security Benchmark:** Sets a benchmark for [[wireless security]], pushing future developments in [[encryption]] and authentication technologies.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Robust [[Encryption]]:** [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]] provides a strong [[encryption]] mechanism that is resistant to many of the attacks that compromised [[Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)|WPA]].
- **Regular Security Updates:** Continual updates and patches to address new vulnerabilities as they are discovered.
- **Enhanced Authentication:** WPA2-Enterprise uses a RADIUS server for authentication, providing better identity verification and [[Access Control in Smart Contracts|access control]].

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Configuration Errors:** Improper setup and weak passwords in WPA2-PSK can still leave networks vulnerable.
- **KRACK Vulnerability:** Key Reinstallation Attacks (KRACK) can exploit weaknesses in the WPA2 protocol to decrypt network traffic, although patches are available.

## Common Tools/Software

- **[[Wireshark]]:** Can be used for detailed analysis of WPA2 encrypted traffic with appropriate keys.
- **[[Aircrack-ng]]:** Popular tool for [[network security]] testing, capable of testing WPA2 configurations under certain scenarios.

## Current Status

- **Standard Protocol:** WPA2 remains the standard security protocol for most modern wireless networks, though WPA3 has been introduced to address its shortcomings.
- **Recommendation for Upgrade:** Users are encouraged to use devices and software that support the latest security updates and consider transitioning to WPA3 for enhanced security features.

## Revision History

- **2024-05-10:** Initial entry created, providing a comprehensive overview of WPA2, its importance, and current relevance.
