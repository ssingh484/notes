# NIST Special Publication 800-144

NIST Special Publication 800-144, titled "Guidelines on Security and Privacy in Public Cloud Computing," provides comprehensive guidance on the security and privacy challenges posed by public cloud environments. It offers recommendations for mitigating risks associated with the adoption and use of public cloud services.

## Key Features

- **Risk Assessment:** Emphasizes the importance of assessing the security and privacy risks before adopting cloud computing solutions.
- **Governance:** Stresses the need for effective governance structures to oversee cloud security and privacy policies and processes.
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Highlights the critical role of SLAs in defining the security and privacy expectations between cloud providers and clients.

## How It Works

The publication works as a guideline for organizations to understand and navigate the security challenges associated with public cloud services. It aids in the decision-making process by outlining key considerations for securing data and managing privacy in cloud environments.

## Common Techniques

- **Data [[Encryption]]:** Recommends encrypting data both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information.
- **Access Controls:** Suggests implementing strong access control mechanisms to limit who can access data in the cloud.
- **Incident Response:** Advises on establishing a robust incident response plan specifically tailored to the cloud.
- **[[Virtual Private Networks]] ([[Virtual Private Networks|VPNs]]):** Recommends the use of [[Virtual Private Networks|VPNs]] to secure data communications to and from the cloud.

## Advantages

- **Guided Security Practices:** Provides organizations with a structured approach to securing cloud environments.
- **Enhanced Risk Management:** Helps organizations identify and manage risks effectively, promoting a safer cloud adoption and operation strategy.
- **Increased Awareness:** Raises awareness about the specific security and privacy challenges in cloud computing.

## Major Tools

While SP 800-144 does not specify tools, it encourages the use of industry-standard technologies and practices that support the guidelines. Tools commonly used in line with these recommendations include:

- **Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs):** Tools that sit between cloud users and cloud applications to monitor activity and enforce security policies.
- **Security Management Platforms:** Solutions that provide visibility and control over cloud data and resources.
- **Compliance and Audit Software:** Tools that help ensure cloud services meet industry standards and regulations.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP):** Provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services used by federal agencies.
- **ISO/IEC 27018:** Establishes commonly accepted control objectives, controls, and guidelines for implementing measures to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in public cloud computing environments.

## Best Practices

- Conduct comprehensive risk assessments before adopting cloud services.
- Clearly define security responsibilities between the cloud provider and the client.
- Implement and maintain strong [[encryption]] practices for data security.
- Regularly review and update security practices in response to evolving threats and technologies.

## Current Status

As cloud computing continues to evolve, the guidelines in NIST SP 800-144 remain vital for organizations leveraging cloud technologies. The publication is reviewed periodically to ensure its recommendations stay relevant to current technology and threat landscapes.
