# Endpoint Security

Endpoint Security refers to the practices and technologies employed to protect individual devices such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets within an organization. These devices, called endpoints, serve as points of access to the organizational network and can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to network resources.

## How It Works

Endpoint security solutions work by deploying endpoint protection platforms (EPP) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems on each device. These systems monitor the device for suspicious activities, enforce security policies, and can automatically respond to detected threats by isolating the device, deleting malicious files, or blocking malicious activity.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously scans the endpoints for [[malware]] and other threats.
- **Threat Detection and Response:** Identifies and mitigates threats using automated tools.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Applies organizational security policies across all endpoints to ensure compliance and security.
- **Patch Management:** Automates the process of deploying software updates to fix vulnerabilities in operating systems and applications.

## Common Techniques

- **Antivirus and Anti-malware Software:** These are fundamental for detecting and removing malicious software.
- **[[Firewalls]]:** Restrict unauthorized access to endpoints by blocking unwanted traffic.
- **[[Encryption]]:** Protects data stored on endpoints, ensuring that data remains secure even if the device is lost or stolen.
- **Application Control:** Restricts endpoint users to operating approved applications to prevent execution of malicious or unauthorized software.
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM):** Provides specific controls for securing mobile devices within the enterprise.

## Advantages

- **Reduced Risk of Data Breaches:** Effective endpoint security minimizes the chances of breaches by securing potential entry points into the network.
- **Improved Network Health:** By securing individual endpoints, the overall health and security of the network are enhanced.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Helps organizations comply with data protection regulations by securing sensitive data on endpoints.
- **Flexibility and Scalability:** Modern endpoint security solutions can easily be scaled and adapted to protect new devices as an organization grows.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-53]]:** Provides guidelines for managing the security of federal information systems, including recommendations for endpoint security.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Specifies security management best practices that include endpoint security to protect information assets.
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]]):** Implies the need for endpoint security to protect personal data within organizations operating in or with the EU.
- **[[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)|HIPAA]] ([[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]]):** Requires endpoint security measures to protect electronic personal health information.

## Best Practices

- Keep all endpoint devices and software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance access controls on devices.
- Regularly back up data to protect against data loss in case of a security breach.
- Educate employees about cybersecurity risks and safe practices to prevent [[phishing]] and other [[Social Engineering Techniques|social engineering]] attacks.

## Current Status

Endpoint security continues to evolve with advancements in technology and changes in the cyber [[threat landscape]]. The rise of remote work has further highlighted the importance of robust endpoint security measures as employees access organizational resources from various locations and devices.
