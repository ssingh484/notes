# ISO/IEC 27037

ISO/IEC 27037, titled "Guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition, and preservation of digital evidence," is an international standard that provides guidelines for handling digital evidence. It is part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, which focus on information security management systems. This standard is specifically designed to help organizations and forensic practitioners ensure the integrity and authenticity of digital evidence from the point of identification through to collection, acquisition, and preservation.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Process:** Establishes a standardized approach to managing digital evidence, which is crucial for maintaining its admissibility and reliability in legal proceedings.
- **Guidance on Handling Procedures:** Offers detailed procedures for the secure handling of digital evidence to prevent accidental or intentional alteration, loss, or destruction.
- **Compatibility with Legal Systems:** Designed to be compatible with the diverse requirements of different legal systems, ensuring that digital evidence handled according to these guidelines can be used in legal proceedings worldwide.
- **Cross-Disciplinary Application:** Applicable across various fields, including law enforcement, private security, and corporate compliance.

## How It Works

ISO/IEC 27037 guides the processes involved in digital forensics and evidence handling through several stages:

1. **Identification:** Recognizing potential digital evidence in various forms and environments.
2. **Collection and Acquisition:** Systematically collecting and acquiring digital evidence in a manner that preserves its integrity.
3. **Preservation:** Securely storing and protecting evidence from tampering or degradation.
4. **Documentation:** Keeping detailed records of all actions taken with the evidence, including who handled it and the methods used for its preservation.

## Common Techniques

- **Write Blocking:** Using tools that allow the capture of information from digital devices without allowing any modifications.
- **Imaging:** Creating exact bit-by-bit copies of digital storage devices.
- **Chain of Custody Documentation:** Maintaining continuous and well-documented records of the evidence's custody to ensure its integrity.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Credibility:** Helps ensure the credibility and acceptability of digital evidence in legal contexts.
- **Consistency:** Promotes consistency in digital evidence handling, which is beneficial for multinational operations and cases involving multiple jurisdictions.
- **Best Practices Framework:** Provides organizations with a framework of best practices for securing digital evidence.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-86]]:** While focused on integrating forensic techniques into incident responses, it complements ISO/IEC 27037 by providing broader guidelines that include the handling of digital evidence.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Establishes an information security management system (ISMS) that includes the protection of digital evidence as part of an overall approach to information security.

## Best Practices

- Train personnel on the proper techniques and importance of handling digital evidence according to ISO/IEC 27037.
- Use approved and validated tools and software for the collection and preservation of digital evidence.
- Regularly audit and review the procedures involved in the handling of digital evidence to ensure compliance with the standard.

## Current Status

ISO/IEC 27037 continues to be a critical standard for organizations involved in digital forensics and legal investigations. As digital technologies evolve and new types of digital evidence emerge, updates and revisions to the standard are necessary to address these changes effectively.
