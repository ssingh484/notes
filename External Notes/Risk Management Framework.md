# NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

The NIST [[Risk Management]] Framework (RMF) provides a structured process for organizations to assess, manage, and continuously monitor information security risks. Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the RMF aims to integrate security and risk management activities into the system development life cycle.

## How It Works

The RMF consists of six steps designed to help organizations manage security and privacy risks:

1. **Categorize Information Systems:** Identify and categorize information and information systems according to their importance to business operations and their sensitivity in terms of security and privacy.
2. **Select Security Controls:** Select appropriate security controls for the system based on the categorization and tailor them according to organizational needs and assessment results.
3. **Implement Security Controls:** Implement selected controls and document how the controls are deployed within the system and environment.
4. **Assess Security Controls:** Assess the effectiveness of implemented security controls to determine if they are functioning as intended and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements.
5. **Authorize Information System:** Make a risk management decision based on the information obtained through the assessment of the effectiveness of security controls.
6. **Monitor Security Controls:** Continuously monitor the security controls in the information system to ensure they effectively manage risk in a dynamic environment.

## Common Techniques

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly reviewing the security controls and the status of information systems.
- **Gap Analysis:** Identifying and addressing gaps between current security postures and desired outcomes.
- **Threat Modeling:** Analyzing potential threats and designing controls to mitigate them.

## Advantages

- **Standardized Approach:** Provides a consistent, structured, and repeatable process for managing security risks.
- **Improved Security Posture:** Helps organizations proactively identify and address security weaknesses before they can be exploited.
- **Compliance:** Supports compliance with federal regulations and industry standards.
- **Integrated Risk Management:** Incorporates privacy and security in the system development lifecycle, enhancing overall risk management.

## Major Tools

- **eMASS (Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service):** A government-provided tool that supports the RMF process, offering automation support for the application of the RMF in IT systems.
- **RSA Archer:** Provides integrated risk management capabilities that help organizations manage risks, demonstrate compliance, and automate business processes.
- **Tenable.sc (formerly SecurityCenter):** Assists in continuous network monitoring and provides a comprehensive view of [[network security]], helping to identify vulnerabilities and monitor changes that could impact security controls.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-37]],** "Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems": A comprehensive guide that explains how to apply the RMF to federal information systems.
- **Federal Information Security Modernization Act ([[Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)|FISMA]]):** Requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to provide information security for their data and systems, for which the RMF provides a structured methodology.
