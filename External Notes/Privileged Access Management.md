# Privileged Access Management (PAM)

Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a critical security measure that involves managing and monitoring access to critical systems and data through the control of privileged accounts. These accounts have elevated permissions and are often targeted by attackers due to their high level of access to sensitive information.

## How It Works

- **Credential Storage:** PAM systems securely store and manage credentials for privileged accounts, often in a centralized vault.
- **Access Controls:** Access to privileged accounts is strictly controlled and monitored, with [[authentication mechanisms]] like multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized users gain access.
- **Session Management:** PAM tools can monitor, record, and manage sessions initiated by privileged users to prevent unauthorized activities and provide audit trails.
- **Least Privilege Enforcement:** Implements the principle of least privilege by providing users with minimum levels of access necessary for their job functions.

## Key Features

- **Automated Credential Rotation:** Regularly updates privileged credentials to reduce the risk of credential theft.
- **Real-time Monitoring and Alerts:** Tracks privileged activities and generates alerts on suspicious behaviors, helping to prevent or mitigate security breaches.
- **Integration with Identity Management Systems:** Works alongside [[identity and access management]] ([[Identity and Access Management|IAM]]) systems to provide a comprehensive approach to securing access across all types of accounts.

## Problem Addressed

PAM addresses the security risks associated with privileged accounts, which include unauthorized access to critical systems, escalation of privileges by attackers, and insider threats. Managing these accounts effectively helps prevent data breaches and maintain system integrity.

## Implications

Effective PAM practices are essential for maintaining security and compliance within an organization, particularly for industries that are highly regulated and handle sensitive data. Without robust PAM, organizations are at a higher risk of security incidents that can lead to significant financial and reputational damage.

## Impact

Implementing PAM solutions helps organizations protect critical assets, meet compliance requirements, and reduce the risk of security breaches caused by compromised privileged credentials. It also enhances the overall security posture by ensuring that privileged access is granted according to strict policies and is closely monitored.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Session Recording:** Captures detailed logs of all actions performed during a privileged session for audit and forensic analysis.
- **Time-based and Context-based Restrictions:** Limits privileged access based on time or environmental contexts to reduce the attack surface.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Uses behavioral analytics to detect and respond to unusual activities that could signify a security breach.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

The main vulnerability in PAM lies in the potential for misuse of privileged credentials, either by external attackers through credential theft or by insiders abusing their access rights.

## Common Tools/Software

- **CyberArk:** Provides comprehensive PAM solutions, including credential management and session monitoring.
- **Thycotic Secret Server:** Offers secure management of privileged accounts and automates password changes.
- **BeyondTrust:** Delivers privileged account management and session monitoring capabilities.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-53|NIST SP 800-53]]:** Provides guidance on access control policies, including those relevant to managing privileged access.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Includes requirements for information security management systems that cover the management of privileged access.
- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX):** Requires proper internal controls over financial reporting, which includes managing access to systems that handle financial data.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and update privileged access policies and procedures.
- Employ robust authentication measures and session monitoring for all privileged sessions.
- Conduct frequent audits of privileged access use to ensure compliance with policies and detect any unauthorized access or policy violations.

## Current Status

As cyber threats evolve, the role of PAM in security strategies continues to grow. Organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of sophisticated PAM solutions in protecting against the exploitation of privileged credentials.
