# Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 is United States legislation that defines the comprehensive framework to protect government information, operations, and assets against natural or man-made threats. FISMA was enacted as part of the Electronic Government Act of 2002. It emphasizes the importance of information security to the economic and national security interests of the United States.

## Key Features

- **Risk Management Framework:** Requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.
- **[[NIST Cybersecurity Framework|NIST Guidelines]]:** Mandates the use of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and guidelines to help agencies implement effective information security.
- **Annual Reviews:** Agencies must conduct annual reviews of their information security programs and report the results to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
- **Independent Evaluations:** Requires periodic independent evaluations of the effectiveness of an agency’s information security program.

## Problem Addressed

FISMA addresses the need for robust information security controls and management practices to protect federal government information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

## Implications

FISMA compliance is crucial for federal agencies and businesses that contract with the government, ensuring that sensitive data is protected according to standardized practices. Compliance helps safeguard national security and public safety.

## Impact

FISMA has had a profound impact on the way federal agencies manage their information security, leading to more standardized security practices across government entities. It also influences the policies and practices of state agencies and private sector companies that interact with federal agencies.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Information Security Policies:** Development of detailed policies that govern the protection of information and IT systems.
- **Security Awareness Training:** Providing training for employees on the importance of security and how to protect sensitive information.
- **Incident Response:** Implementation of procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Despite the framework provided by FISMA, agencies may struggle with implementation due to resource constraints, evolving technology, and changing cyber threats, potentially leaving gaps in security that can be exploited.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Compliance Software:** Tools designed to help organizations meet FISMA requirements, such as SolarWinds, Tenable Nessus, and IBM’s QRadar.
- **[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)|Security Information and Event Management]] ([[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)|SIEM]]) Systems:** Such as Splunk, LogRhythm, and AlienVault, which help monitor, detect, and report on security incidents.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST SP 800 Series:** A set of documents that provide the guidelines and technical standards to fulfill the FISMA requirements.
- **OMB Circular A-130:** Manages information as a strategic resource, intertwined with FISMA regulations to oversee federal information resources management policies.

## Best Practices

- Continuously monitor and assess risks to adapt security controls as needed.
- Ensure that all employees are trained on security policies and incident response procedures.
- Regularly review and update security policies to align with current technologies and threats.

## Current Status

FISMA continues to evolve with changes in technology and cybersecurity threats. Legislative updates and amendments, such as the FISMA Reform Act, aim to strengthen the act’s requirements and ensure it remains effective in the face of modern challenges.
