# ISO/IEC 29192-3

ISO/IEC 29192-3, part of the ISO/IEC 29192 series, focuses on lightweight [[cryptography]], specifically covering [[Asymmetric Encryption|public key cryptography]]. This standard is designed to provide guidelines and requirements for [[cryptographic algorithms]] that are suitable for environments with limited computational resources, such as embedded systems, IoT devices, and mobile applications.

## Key Features

- **Efficiency:** Emphasizes [[Algorithm|algorithms]] that require minimal processing power, memory, and energy consumption.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for use in a range of devices, from low-power sensors to more capable consumer electronics.
- **Security:** Despite being lightweight, these cryptographic methods must still meet rigorous security standards suitable for their intended use cases.

## Problem Addressed

ISO/IEC 29192-3 addresses the need for secure cryptographic solutions in devices and platforms where traditional [[Algorithm|algorithms]] would be too computationally expensive or power-intensive. This includes environments where battery life is critical or processing power is minimal.

## Implications

The adoption of lightweight cryptographic standards like ISO/IEC 29192-3 is crucial for ensuring the security of increasingly connected devices in the IoT and mobile sectors, which are often limited by resource constraints.

## Impact

Implementing ISO/IEC 29192-3 enhances the ability of manufacturers and application developers to provide adequate security measures in resource-constrained environments. This standard helps in mitigating risks associated with data breaches and attacks on these devices, thereby protecting sensitive information and maintaining user trust.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Resource-Efficient Algorithms:** The standard includes [[Algorithm|algorithms]] that have been optimized for low resource usage, including reduced key sizes and simpler computations that still provide adequate security.
- **Adaptable Security Levels:** Offers different levels of security to accommodate varying degrees of threat, allowing implementers to balance security needs with resource availability.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Due to the constraints on computational resources, lightweight [[cryptographic algorithms]] might face unique vulnerabilities, such as side-channel attacks, which could exploit physical emanations from the cryptographic implementation.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Cryptographic Libraries:** Many cryptographic libraries are adapting to include support for lightweight [[cryptography]] standards specified in ISO/IEC 29192-3, ensuring developers have access to compliant tools.
- **Security Modules:** Embedded security modules designed for IoT devices often implement standards from ISO/IEC 29192-3 to ensure data protection without compromising device performance.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]]):** While not directly linked, the implementation of ISO/IEC 29192-3 compliant [[Algorithm|algorithms]] can help meet [[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]]'s requirements for data security, especially in consumer devices.
- **NIST Guidelines for IoT Security:** NIST publications often reference the need for lightweight cryptographic solutions in IoT environments, which aligns with the standards set by ISO/IEC 29192-3.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct assessments to ensure that the cryptographic measures remain effective against evolving threats.
- **Update and Patch Management:** Keep the cryptographic implementations up to date to guard against vulnerabilities.
- **Security by Design:** Incorporate ISO/IEC 29192-3 standards from the beginning of the device or application development process to ensure robust security.

## Current Status

As the landscape of embedded and mobile technologies evolves, the relevance of ISO/IEC 29192-3 continues to grow. Ongoing research and development in the field of lightweight cryptography are expected to enhance and expand the standards to cover new technologies and emerging security challenges.
