# Pretexting

Pretexting is a [[Social Engineering Techniques|social engineering]] tactic where an attacker creates a fabricated scenario, or pretext, to deceive a target into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that they would not typically undertake. The pretext is carefully crafted to make the interaction appear legitimate and trustworthy.

## Key Features

- **Fabricated Scenarios:** Involves creating believable stories or scenarios to engage the target.
- **Trust Manipulation:** Leverages the target’s trust in authority, familiarity, or urgency.
- **Personalization:** Often tailored to the target’s specific circumstances or environment.
- **Deception:** The core tactic relies on deceiving the target into compliance.

## Problem Addressed

Pretexting addresses the challenge of obtaining sensitive information or gaining unauthorized access by exploiting human psychology. It bypasses technical security measures by targeting the human element, which is often the weakest link in the security chain.

## Implications

- **Security Breach:** Can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or systems.
- **Identity Theft:** Facilitates the theft of personal or corporate identities.
- **Financial Fraud:** Can result in financial losses through deceptive practices.
- **Operational Disruption:** May lead to significant disruptions in business operations.

## Impact

- **Loss of Trust:** Erodes trust in communication channels and verification processes.
- **Financial and Data Loss:** Can cause substantial financial and data breaches.
- **Reputation Damage:** Companies may suffer reputational damage if pretexting leads to publicized security failures.
- **Regulatory Consequences:** Potential legal and regulatory repercussions for failing to protect against such attacks.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Employee Training:** Regularly educate employees about pretexting tactics and how to recognize them.
- **Verification Protocols:** Implement strict verification processes to confirm the identity of individuals requesting sensitive information.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Use MFA to add an additional layer of security beyond just passwords or knowledge-based questions.
- **Incident Reporting:** Encourage a culture of reporting suspicious interactions and potential pretexting attempts.
- **Awareness Programs:** Develop ongoing security awareness programs to keep pretexting threats top of mind.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Human Error:** Relies on the likelihood of human error or lack of awareness.
- **Trust Exploitation:** Exploits natural human tendencies to trust authority figures or familiar scenarios.
- **Lack of Verification:** Takes advantage of inadequate or lax verification processes.
- **Social Media:** Uses information available on social media and other public sources to craft convincing pretexts.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Social Media Platforms:** Used to gather information about targets to create convincing pretexts.
- **[[OSINT]] Tools:** [[OSINT|Open-source intelligence]] tools to collect publicly available information.
- **Communication Tools:** Email, phone, and messaging apps to execute pretexting scenarios.

## Best Practices

- **Continuous Training:** Conduct regular training sessions to keep employees aware of the latest pretexting tactics.
- **Strict Verification:** Always verify the identity of individuals requesting sensitive information through multiple channels.
- **MFA Enforcement:** Implement and enforce multi-factor authentication for accessing sensitive systems and information.
- **Clear Policies:** Establish and communicate clear policies for handling sensitive information and requests.
- **Regular Audits:** Perform regular audits of security protocols and employee adherence to policies.
- **Role-Playing Exercises:** Conduct role-playing exercises to simulate pretexting attacks and improve employee response.
- **Information Minimization:** Limit the amount of personal information shared on public platforms to reduce the risk of being targeted.

## Current Status

Pretexting remains a prevalent and effective [[Social Engineering Techniques|social engineering]] tactic. Despite increasing [[awareness and training]], many organizations still fall victim to pretexting due to its reliance on human psychology and the ingenuity of attackers. Continuous education and robust verification processes are essential to mitigate this threat.
