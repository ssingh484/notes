# Critical Security Controls

Critical Security Controls are a set of best practices designed to prevent, detect, and mitigate the most pervasive and dangerous threats to [[network security]]. These controls are often developed and refined by cybersecurity organizations in collaboration with IT security experts and are based on real-world data about actual attacks and breaches.

## Overview of Security Controls

The critical security controls are generally categorized into three groups: Basic, Foundational, and Organizational. Each category targets different aspects of IT security, from essential hygiene to more advanced defensive measures.

## Categories and Examples

### Basic Security Controls

| Control                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                | How to Exploit                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets**            | Actively manage all hardware devices on the network so that only authorized devices are given access and unauthorized devices are found and prevented from gaining access. | Attackers are particularly interested in devices that come & go off the enterprise's network. BYOD = vulnerable.        |
| **Inventory and Control of Software Assets**            | Ensure that only authorized software is installed and can execute, and that unauthorized software is found and prevented from installation or execution.                   | Use vulnerable softwares to compromise machines. Look for unpatched vulnerabilities.                                    |
| **Continuous Vulnerability Management**                 | Continuously acquire, assess, and take action on new information to identify vulnerabilities, remediate, and minimize the window of opportunity for attackers.             | Attackers have access to the same info & take advantage of gaps between knowledge to remediation.                       |
| **Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges**         | Use processes and tools to track/control/prevent/correct the use, assignment, and configuration of administrative privileges on computers, networks, and applications.     | Attackers try to take advantage of uncontrolled admin privileges or gain an Elevation of Privileges.                    |
| **Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software**      | Establish, implement, and actively manage security configurations of laptops, servers, and workstations to remove vulnerabilities and enforce security baselines.          | Default configurations are geared towards ease of use, not security. Can be exploited in default state.                 |
| **Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs** | Collect, manage, and analyze audit logs of events that could help detect, understand, or recover from an attack.                                                           | Deficiencies in security logging allow hackers to hide location, malicious software, and activities on victim machines. |

### Foundational Security Controls

| Control                                         | Description                                                                                                                                   | How to Exploit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email and Web Browser Protections**           | Minimize the attack surface and the opportunities for attackers by controlling the use of potentially risky web and email content.            | Very common point of entry/attack. Entice/spoof users here. Main means where targets interact with untrusted environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **[[Malware]] Defenses**                        | Control the installation, spread, and execution of malicious code at multiple points in the enterprise.                                       | Use modern malware, designed to avoid defenses, then attack/disable them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Limitation and Control of Network Ports**     | Manage the network infrastructure to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable services and settings.                                      | Look to remotely exploit poorly configured web servers, mail servers, file and print services and DNS servers installed by default on a variety of device types.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Data Recovery Capabilities**                  | Ensure that data can be recovered reliably and quickly after a compromise.                                                                    | Make significant changes to configurations and software. Make it impossible for trustworthy data recovery sans attackers presence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Secure Configuration for Network Devices**    | Establish a robust security configuration for network devices such as [[firewalls]], routers, and switches.                                   | Default configurations for network infrastructure are insecure. Open services and ports, default accounts, passwords, pre-installed unnecessary software, & support for older protocols. Also search for gaps/inconsistencies in Firewall rulesets, routers, and switches. Use this to gain access to a network, redirect traffic, and intercept information. |
| **Boundary Defense**                            | Control the flow of traffic through network borders and police content by leveraging security configurations and architecture.                | Exploit weaknesses on perimeter systems, network devices, and internet-accessing client machines to gain initial access, reroute traffic, or intercept data.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Data Protection**                             | Prioritize the protection of critical assets by isolating them from less sensitive, publicly accessible information within internal networks. | Target sensitive data for exfiltration, physical damage, or operational disruption to compromise organizational integrity and security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Controlled Access Based on the Need to Know** | Restrict access and permissions strictly to individuals whose roles require it, ensuring secure and relevant data flow.                       | Scrutinize data movement across network boundaries. Look for privilege creep for users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Wireless Access Control**                     | Implement robust security measures for wireless networks by securing access points, utilizing strong encryption, and segregating networks.    | Exploit weak encryption and poorly secured access points to infiltrate network systems and implant backdoors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Account Monitoring and Control**              | Regularly review and deactivate obsolete user accounts to maintain a secure and current user base.                                            | Use dormant but legitimate user accounts to impersonate authorized users and bypass security protocols, particularly focusing on accounts left from Red Team tests.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Organizational Security Controls

| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security [[Awareness and Training]]**         | Create programs for all employees to understand their roles in maintaining good security practices.                                                                                                                             | Make a super fake phishing-looking email and then hide the malicious link in the "report this email" link.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Application Software Security**               | Protect against vulnerabilities found in web-based and other application software.                                                                                                                                              | Look for coding mistakes, logic errors, incomplete requirements, and failure to test for unusual or unexpected conditions. Try SQL injection. Specific errors: failure to: check the size of user input; filter out unneeded but malicious character sequences from input streams; initialize and clear variables, and poor memory management allowing flaws in unrelated areas to affect security critical portions. |
| **Incident Response and Management**            | Develop and implement an incident response infrastructure for quickly discovering an attack and effectively containing the damage, eradicating the attacker's presence, and restoring the integrity of the network and systems. | Strike as quickly as possible before emergency action plans are carried out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **[[Penetration Testing]] and [[Red Teaming]]** | Test the effectiveness of security configurations and practices by simulating the tactics and techniques of potential attackers.                                                                                                | Exploit the gap between good defensive designs and intentions and implementation or maintenance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

Adherence to critical security controls is often part of compliance with various regulatory and industry standards, including but not limited to:

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-53|NIST SP 800-53]],** for federal information systems except those related to national security.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]],** which provides requirements for an information security management system (ISMS).
- **[[PCI DSS]],** for organizations that handle credit card transactions.

## Best Practices

- **Regularly Update Controls:** Security environments and threats evolve; therefore, it is crucial to update controls and practices continually.
- **Integrate Controls into a Holistic Security Program:** Controls should not function in isolation but as part of a comprehensive security strategy.
- **Automate Controls When Possible:** Automation can help maintain consistency and reduce the potential for human error.

## Current Status

As cyber threats evolve, so too do critical security controls. Organizations and cybersecurity groups periodically review and update these controls to stay ahead of [[emerging threats]].
