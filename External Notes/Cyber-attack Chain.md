# Cyber-attack Chain

The Cyber-attack Chain, also known as the "kill chain," is a term used to describe the typical stages of a cyber-attack from the early reconnaissance stages to the final actions that achieve the attacker's objectives. Understanding and disrupting this chain at any stage can help to mitigate or prevent attacks.

## How It Works

The cyber-attack chain model breaks down an attack into sequential steps that cybercriminals follow to breach a system and extract data or cause damage:

1. **Reconnaissance:** Attackers gather preliminary data such as network and system vulnerabilities. 
2. **Weaponization:** Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload. 
3. **Delivery:** Transmission of the weaponized bundle through email, websites, USB, or other delivery methods.
4. **Exploitation:** Exploiting a vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system.
5. **Installation:** Installation of a backdoor/malware to allow persistent access to the target network.
6. **Command and Control (C&C):** Communication with outbound signals to an external server that allows remote manipulation of the victim.
7. **Actions on Objectives:** The attacker achieves their goals, such as data exfiltration, data destruction, or [[ransomware]] deployment.

## Implications

The cyber-attack chain framework provides security teams with a methodical approach to anticipate and disrupt cyber attacks by addressing vulnerabilities at each stage.

## Impact

Understanding the cyber-attack chain can greatly enhance an organization's cybersecurity strategy by focusing on preventing attackers from completing their objectives, thus reducing the overall risk of security breaches.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **[[Intrusion Detection Systems|Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)]]:** To detect unusual network activities at various stages of the attack chain.
- **[[Firewalls]] and [[Encryption]]:** To block unauthorized data transmissions.
- **[[Endpoint Security]]:** To prevent [[malware]] installation and detect anomalous activities on individual devices.
- **Regular Software Updates and Patch Management:** To mitigate the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Each stage of the attack chain presents specific vulnerabilities that, if not properly secured, can be exploited by attackers. For example, insufficient email filtering can allow [[phishing]] attacks to deliver [[malware]] to targets.

## Common Tools/Software

- **[[Wireshark]]:** Network protocol analyzer that can be used in the reconnaissance phase.
- **[[Metasploit]]:** A tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine.
- **[[External Notes/Mimikatz]]:** Used in the exploitation phase to obtain credentials.
- **[[Cobalt Strike]]:** Software used for maintaining persistence and command and control capabilities within a network.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-53]]:** Provides guidelines for implementing effective security measures that can disrupt the cyber-attack chain.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Offers best practices for information security management systems that can address various stages of the cyber-attack chain.
- **The Cybersecurity Framework by NIST:** Helps organizations assess and improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber attacks.

## Advantages

- **Proactive Defense:** Allows organizations to identify and mitigate threats before they result in significant damage.
- **Strategic Focus:** Helps prioritize security initiatives by highlighting critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited in an attack.
- **Incident Response:** Improves the effectiveness of incident response plans by understanding attacker actions and motives.

## Current Status

As cyber threats evolve, the cyber-attack chain model continues to be refined and adapted. Security professionals are increasingly integrating machine learning and AI technologies to predict and combat attacks more effectively.
