# Penetration Testing Frameworks

Penetration Testing Frameworks are structured methodologies and sets of tools used to evaluate the security of a system or network by simulating attacks from malicious outsiders or insiders. These frameworks guide security professionals through the process of testing, from initial analysis to vulnerability exploitation, and reporting.

## How It Works

[[Penetration testing]] typically follows a systematic approach:

1. **Planning and Reconnaissance:** Defining the scope and goals of a test, gathering intelligence (like network and domain details) to understand how a target works and its potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Scanning:** Using tools to automatically discover system weaknesses; includes port scanning and vulnerability scans.
3. **Gaining Access:** Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities to enter the system or network.
4. **Maintaining Access:** Seeing if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system, mimicking [[Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)|advanced persistent threats]].
5. **Analysis and Reporting:** Documenting the vulnerabilities found, the data that was accessed, and the time the tester was able to remain in the system unnoticed. Recommendations for securing the system are also provided.

## Common Techniques

- **[[Social Engineering Techniques|Social Engineering]]:** Manipulating users to gain physical or digital access to confidential areas.
- **Network Services Attack:** Exploiting weaknesses in network services to gain unauthorized access or privileges.
- **Application Attacks:** Targeting flaws in applications to inject malicious code or retrieve sensitive data.
- **Client-Side Attacks:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in client-side applications like web browsers and document readers.
- **Password Cracking:** Using various techniques to decode passwords or [[encryption]] keys.

## Advantages

- **Identifying Vulnerabilities:** Helps identify exploitable vulnerabilities in the system before they can be discovered and exploited by attackers.
- **Testing Cyber-Defense Capability:** Allows an organization to test how effective its defense mechanisms are in a safe environment.
- **Compliance with Regulatory Requirements:** Helps ensure compliance with standards that require regular security assessments, such as [[PCI DSS]] and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)|HIPAA]].
- **Training Opportunities:** Provides a training tool for security personnel to practice defensive and offensive capabilities.

## Major Frameworks

- **Metasploit:** Provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in [[penetration testing]] and [[Intrusion Detection Systems|IDS]] signature development.
- **Burp Suite:** An integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications.
- **Core Impact:** A powerful tool for penetration testers that replicates attacks to test network vulnerabilities.
- **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy):** An open-source tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications during testing phases.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-115]],** "Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment": Provides guidelines for planning, conducting, and analyzing information security tests, including penetration tests.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Sets out the requirements for an information security management system (ISMS) and includes conducting regular security assessments, which can involve [[penetration testing]].

## Best Practices

- Always obtain explicit permission before testing a network or system to avoid legal implications.
- Define clear scope and goals for each penetration test to ensure thorough and focused testing efforts.
- Keep detailed records of all tests and findings to help in remediation and future testing.
- Ensure testers have the necessary skills and knowledge to conduct tests effectively and safely.

## Current Status

As cybersecurity threats evolve, penetration testing frameworks continue to be updated with new techniques and tools to address emerging vulnerabilities and strengthen security practices. Staying current with the latest developments in these frameworks is crucial for maintaining effective security defenses.
