# Data Poisoning

**Data poisoning** refers to a type of adversarial attack in which malicious data is injected into training datasets, causing machine learning models to produce inaccurate, biased, or harmful results. It undermines the integrity and reliability of machine learning systems by manipulating data before or during model training.

## Key Features

- **Training-Time Attack:** Targets machine learning models during the training phase by introducing manipulated data.
- **Evasive in Nature:** Maliciously modified data often appears legitimate, making it challenging to detect.
- **Widespread Impact:** Can affect models used in cybersecurity, healthcare, autonomous driving, and more.
- **Adaptability:** Different types of poisoning attacks, including backdoor attacks, label flipping, and gradient matching.
- **Intentional Influence:** Can cause models to underperform, overfit, or misclassify specific instances.

## Problem Addressed

- **Trustworthiness of Machine Learning Models:** Undermines model integrity, leading to reduced reliability in critical applications.
- **Vulnerability to Malicious Actors:** Opens avenues for adversaries to manipulate machine learning systems covertly.
- **Decision-Making Accuracy:** Compromises models used in critical decision-making systems like credit scoring or medical diagnosis.

## Implications

- **Critical Decision Errors:** Misclassification or bias in decision-making applications like autonomous vehicles or healthcare.
- **Security Risks:** Exposure to adversarial attacks in cybersecurity applications, such as [[intrusion detection systems]].
- **Ethical Concerns:** Potential for discriminatory biases or privacy violations due to poisoned training data.
- **Financial Impact:** Costs related to inaccurate predictions, regulatory fines, and mitigation efforts.

## Impact

- **Trust Erosion:** Reduces confidence in machine learning models' predictions, leading to skepticism around AI adoption.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Necessitates new regulations around data quality and model auditing.
- **Operational Costs:** Increased expenses due to model retraining, audits, and implementing security measures.
- **Research Evolution:** Advances in adversarial defense mechanisms and robust model training.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Data Validation:** Implementing strict data validation and filtering to detect anomalies.
- **Differential Privacy:** Obscuring individual data contributions to make data poisoning more challenging.
- **Robust Learning Algorithms:** Developing models resilient to adversarial samples, like RANSAC or robust optimization techniques.
- **Model Ensembling:** Combining multiple models to reduce the effect of any single poisoned model.
- **Secure Model Training:** Using trusted environments and tamper-proof storage for training data.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Open-Source Datasets:** Publicly accessible datasets are prone to tampering.
- **Label Manipulation:** Changing labels of training samples to mislead the model.
- **Feature Poisoning:** Altering the features of training data, causing models to learn incorrect relationships.
- **Backdoor Triggers:** Injecting patterns or triggers that activate during specific conditions to manipulate model predictions.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Poisoning Libraries:** Tools like CleverHans and Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) support data poisoning attack simulation.
- **Defensive Platforms:** Privacy-preserving tools like TensorFlow Privacy, IBM Adversarial Robustness Toolbox.
- **Model Auditing Software:** Tools for model interpretability, like LIME and SHAP, help identify potential poisoning effects.

## Current Status

- **Research Focus:** Growing emphasis on understanding and mitigating data poisoning attacks.
- **Policy Development:** Emerging regulations on data security in machine learning pipelines.
- **Industry Adoption:** Companies increasingly invest in adversarial robustness and secure training methods.

## Revision History

- **2024-05-10:** Initial entry created, summarizing core concepts and implications of data poisoning attacks.
