# Web Application Exploitation

Web Application Exploitation involves identifying and leveraging vulnerabilities in web-based applications to gain unauthorized access, extract data, or disrupt services. This practice is typically conducted by malicious actors but can also be part of ethical [[hacking]] ([[penetration testing]]) to improve [[application security]].

## How It Works

The process begins with the identification of potential vulnerabilities through various scanning and testing techniques. Once a vulnerability is identified, an attacker or tester will attempt to exploit it using specific tools or scripts. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious outcomes, depending on the attacker's intent.

## Key Features

- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated tools scan web applications for known vulnerabilities.
- **Manual Testing:** Skilled testers manually probe applications to identify security weaknesses that automated tools might miss.
- **Exploit Execution:** Utilizing known exploits or crafting new ones to take advantage of discovered vulnerabilities.

## Common Techniques

- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Exploiting poor input validation to inject and execute malicious SQL code in a database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users to bypass access controls.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Tricking a user's browser into executing an unwanted action on a web application where they are authenticated.
- **Command Injection:** Exploiting insecure input validation to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Path Traversal:** Exploiting insufficient security validation/sanitization to access files and directories stored outside the intended folder.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **OWASP Top 10:** Lists the top ten most critical [[web application security]] risks and is a standard document used to understand and mitigate common web vulnerabilities.
- **ISO/IEC 27034:** Provides guidelines on integrating security measures into the lifecycle of software development, relevant for preventing web application vulnerabilities.
- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-53]]:** Provides security and privacy controls for federal information systems, including those related to [[web application security]].

## Best Practices

- **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:** Using tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to identify vulnerabilities.
- **[[Penetration Testing]]:** Periodically engaging ethical hackers to perform controlled attacks to test the resilience of web applications.
- **[[Secure Coding Practices]]:** Implementing secure coding guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- **Security Training for Developers:** Ensuring developers are trained in [[secure coding practices]] and are aware of common exploitation techniques.
- **Patch Management:** Regularly updating software to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Impact

Unaddressed vulnerabilities can lead to significant security breaches, affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of web applications. Understanding and mitigating these risks are crucial for maintaining the security and trustworthiness of web applications.

## Current Status

[[Web application security]] is a continuously evolving field, with new vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques emerging as technology advances. Regular updates to security practices and frameworks are necessary to address these evolving threats.
