# Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) is a user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials (such as a username and password). This technology enables users to log in once and gain access to all associated systems without being prompted to log in again at each of them.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Authentication:** Streamlines user access by centralizing the authentication process across various systems and applications.
- **Session and User Management:** Manages user sessions across different systems to ensure that user authentication data is consistently applied and secure.
- **Improved User Experience:** Reduces password fatigue from different user name and password combinations; lowers the time spent re-entering passwords for the same identity.

## How It Works

SSO works by having a central authentication server that all applications trust. Hereâ€™s a simplified step-by-step explanation:

1. **User Login:** The user logs in to the SSO system.
2. **Authentication:** The SSO server verifies the user's credentials. Upon successful authentication, it issues an authentication token.
3. **Token Presentation:** When the user accesses a new application, the application requests authentication information from the SSO server.
4. **Token Validation:** The SSO server validates the token, and if it's valid, informs the application that the user is authenticated.
5. **Access Granted:** The user gains access to the application without needing to re-enter credentials.

## Problem Addressed

SSO addresses the inconvenience of managing multiple credentials across various systems, reducing the complexity for users while enhancing security by minimizing the number of attack vectors for password theft.

## Implications

SSO simplifies the management of user identities and credentials, making it easier for organizations to enforce security policies while improving the user experience. However, it also means that the security of all linked systems can depend heavily on the single set of credentials.

## Impact

The implementation of SSO can lead to significant improvements in productivity and user satisfaction by reducing password complexity and login issues. It also helps in reducing the costs associated with password resets and IT support.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Often integrated with SSO to provide an additional layer of security.
- **[[Encryption]]:** Ensures that all data transmitted between the user, the SSO server, and the applications is encrypted.
- **Regular Security Audits:** To ensure the SSO system and its integrations are secure from vulnerabilities.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

If the central SSO server is compromised, potentially all connected systems are at risk. Also, SSO can be vulnerable to [[phishing]] attacks if not properly secured with additional verification methods like MFA.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Okta:** Provides identity management with Single Sign-On service.
- **Auth0:** Offers Single Sign-On capabilities across a variety of applications.
- **Microsoft Azure Active Directory:** Integrates various directory services with SSO.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-63B]],** "Digital Identity Guidelines": Provides guidance on implementing digital identities, including those used in SSO systems.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Standards for information security management systems, which include requirements for access control and user authentication that are applicable to SSO.

## Best Practices

- Implement strong MFA mechanisms to enhance the security of the SSO architecture.
- Regularly update and patch all components of the SSO solution to protect against vulnerabilities.
- Educate users about [[phishing]] and other social engineering attacks that could compromise their SSO credentials.

## Current Status

As more organizations move towards cloud-based solutions and integrated systems, the adoption of SSO technologies is growing. Ongoing developments in identity management and security practices continue to evolve to meet the challenges of securing SSO frameworks.
