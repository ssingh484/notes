# CRYSTALS-KYBER

CRYSTALS-Kyber is a family of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms founded on the hardness of the Ring Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) problem. It is known for being part of CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) and has been one of the promising candidates in the NIST [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)]] standardization project.

## Key Concepts

- **[[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)]]**: Refers to cryptographic algorithms (usually [[public key]] algorithms) designed to be secure against an attack by a [[Quantum Computing|quantum computer]].
- **Ring-LWE**: The Ring Learning With Errors problem is a variation of the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem, tailored for polynomial rings. Its assumed hardness is the basis for the security of CRYSTALS-Kyber.
