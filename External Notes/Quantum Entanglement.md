## Definition

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other(s), regardless of the distance that separates them.

## Key Characteristics

- **Instantaneous Interaction**: When entangled, a measurement on one particle will instantly determine the state of the other, even if they are light-years apart.
    
- **[[Quantum Superposition|Superposition]]**: Entangled particles exist in a [[Quantum Superposition|superposition]] of states until measured.
    
- **Non-locality**: The phenomenon appears to operate outside the constraints of locality, as changes to one particle's state affect the other particle instantly.
    

## Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Paradox

- Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen published a paper in 1935 presenting entanglement as a "paradox". They questioned whether [[quantum mechanics]] provided a complete description of physical reality.
    
- Einstein famously referred to entanglement as "spooky action at a distance."
    

## Bell's Theorem

- In the 1960s, physicist John Bell proposed an inequality that could test the EPR paradox. Experiments testing Bell's inequality have shown violations, suggesting that entangled particles are genuinely non-local.

## Applications

- **[[Quantum Computing]]**: Entanglement is a key resource in quantum algorithms and quantum parallelism.
    
- **[[Quantum Cryptography]]**: Entangled particles can be used for [[quantum key distribution]], enabling ultra-secure communication.
    
- **Quantum Teleportation**: A protocol that transfers quantum information from one location to another, with the help of two entangled particles and classical communication.
    

## Philosophical and Scientific Implications

- **Reality of Quantum World**: Entanglement challenges classical intuitions about the separability and locality of physical systems.
    
- **Relativity**: The non-local nature of entanglement seems at odds with the theory of relativity, which states that information cannot travel faster than light.
    

## Common Misconceptions

- **Faster-Than-Light Communication**: While entanglement is "non-local", it doesn't allow for faster-than-light communication. The measurement results on entangled particles are random and cannot be controlled.
