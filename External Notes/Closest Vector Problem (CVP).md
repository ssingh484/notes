# Closest Vector Problem (CVP)

The Closest Vector Problem (CVP) is a computational problem arising in [[lattice-based cryptography]], where given a lattice (a grid of points in multidimensional space) and a target point, the goal is to find the lattice point nearest to the target point. This problem is known for its computational hardness, which is exploited in cryptographic applications to ensure security.

## How It Works

1. **Lattice Definition:** A lattice in CVP is defined by a set of basis vectors in a multidimensional space.
2. **Target Point:** A target point, not necessarily on the lattice, is specified.
3. **Distance Metric:** A metric, typically Euclidean, is used to measure the distance between the target point and points on the lattice.
4. **Search Algorithm:** An [[algorithm]] searches for the lattice point that is closest to the target point according to the specified distance metric.

## Advantages

- **Security:** The hardness of solving CVP provides a strong foundation for [[cryptographic security]], particularly against [[quantum computing]] attacks.
- **Versatility:** CVP underpins various [[cryptographic protocols]], including [[Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)|fully homomorphic encryption]] and [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)|post-quantum cryptography]].
- **Scalability:** Lattice-based methods, including those relying on CVP, can be efficiently implemented at scale, offering practical security solutions for large systems.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **Quantum Resistant Cryptography Guidelines:** As part of preparing for the advent of [[quantum computing]], organizations like NIST are exploring [[lattice-based cryptography]] (reliant on problems like CVP) for its potential to resist quantum attacks. NIST's [[Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)|post-quantum cryptography]] project includes developing standards that address [[cryptographic algorithms]] that remain secure against quantum processors.
- **Data Protection Standards:** Regulations such as [[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)|HIPAA]] encourage the adoption of strong and [[quantum-resistant]] cryptographic methods to protect sensitive data, indirectly promoting research and utilization of CVP-based systems.

## Major Tools Used

- **Lattice Reduction Algorithms:** Tools like LLL (Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász) and BKZ (Block Korkin-Zolotarev) are used for simpler instances or as part of more complex [[Algorithm|algorithms]] to approximate solutions to CVP.
- **SVP Solvers:** While not directly solving CVP, [[Shortest Vector Problem (SVP)]] solvers like the General Number Field Sieve are often adapted for use in approximating CVP solutions in cryptographic contexts.
- **Cryptographic Libraries:** Libraries such as NTL (Number Theory Library) and SageMath, which include implementations of lattice reduction techniques and provide environments to experiment with [[lattice-based cryptography]] problems including CVP.

## Current Status

The ongoing research in [[quantum computing]] continues to highlight the importance of problems like CVP in developing secure [[cryptographic protocols]]. As computational power increases and potential quantum threats loom, the relevance and application of CVP in [[cryptography]] continue to grow.
