# ISO/IEC 27017

ISO/IEC 27017 is an international standard providing guidelines for information security controls applicable to the provision and use of cloud services. It serves as a code of practice that enhances and specifies the information security standards under the broader [[ISOIEC 27002|ISO/IEC 27002]], tailored specifically for cloud service environments.

## Key Features

- **Cloud-Specific Controls:** Extends the existing controls in [[ISOIEC 27002|ISO/IEC 27002]] with additional guidance and requirements specific to cloud computing environments.
- **Implementation Guidance:** Offers detailed implementation guidance for both cloud service providers and cloud service customers.
- **Risk Management:** Focuses on addressing the unique risks associated with cloud computing, including data breaches, data loss, and service disruption.

## How It Works

ISO/IEC 27017 works by providing a set of control implementations and enhancements that are specifically designed for securing cloud services. These controls address both the provider's and the customer's sides, ensuring comprehensive security management across different service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and deployment models (public, private, hybrid).

## Common Techniques

- **Shared Security Responsibilities:** Defines the security responsibilities that are typically shared between the cloud provider and the cloud user.
- **Data [[Encryption]]:** Recommends [[encryption]] practices for data at rest and in transit within and between cloud environments.
- **Access Control:** Enhances guidelines on managing access to cloud services, including authentication, authorization, and administration mechanisms.
- **Virtualization Security:** Provides specific controls for securing virtual environments which are prevalent in cloud infrastructures.

## Advantages

- **Enhanced Trust:** Helps build trust between cloud service providers and consumers by demonstrating compliance with internationally recognized standards.
- **Improved Compliance:** Assists organizations in meeting regulatory and compliance requirements that are critical in many sectors.
- **Better Risk Management:** Provides a structured framework for addressing security issues specific to cloud services.

## Major Tools

While ISO/IEC 27017 itself does not specify particular tools, compliance with the standard is often supported by various security management and compliance platforms, such as:

- **Microsoft Compliance Manager:** Helps manage compliance activities, providing a dashboard and detailed implementations related to various standards, including ISO/IEC 27017.
- **AWS Artifact:** Offers on-demand access to AWS' compliance reports, directly supporting compliance with standards like ISO/IEC 27017.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** The broader framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS), of which ISO/IEC 27017 is a complementary standard.
- **[[ISOIEC 27018]]:** Focuses on the protection of personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors, often implemented alongside ISO/IEC 27017 for comprehensive cloud security and privacy.
- **[[FedRAMP]]:** While not directly linked, the controls in FedRAMP for US governmental cloud deployments align with the principles in ISO/IEC 27017 for ensuring cloud security.

## Best Practices

- Implement ISO/IEC 27017 alongside [[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]] to ensure a holistic approach to cloud security.
- Regularly review and update security controls in line with ISO/IEC 27017 to address new cloud security challenges and technologies.
- Engage in continuous monitoring and auditing to ensure compliance and detect security gaps in cloud services.

## Current Status

As cloud computing continues to evolve rapidly, ISO/IEC 27017 remains a vital standard for ensuring that both cloud providers and users maintain robust information security practices. Its guidelines are periodically reviewed and updated to keep pace with technological advances and emerging security threats.
