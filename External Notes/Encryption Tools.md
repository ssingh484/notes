# Encryption Tools

[[Encryption]] tools are software applications and services that implement cryptographic methods to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. They work by converting plaintext into encoded text (ciphertext) that can only be read or decrypted by someone with the correct decryption key.

## How It Works

[[Encryption]] uses [[Algorithm|algorithms]] to transform readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext). To access the original data, the recipient needs the appropriate decryption key. There are two main types of [[encryption]]:

- **[[Symmetric Cryptography|Symmetric Encryption]]:** Uses the same key for both [[encryption]] and decryption. It is fast and efficient for large volumes of data.
- **[[Asymmetric Encryption]]:** Uses a pair of keys—a [[public key]] for [[encryption]] and a [[private key]] for decryption. This type is essential for secure data exchange over insecure networks.

## Common Techniques

- **[[Data Encryption Standard]] ([[Data Encryption Standard|DES]]):** Once a widespread symmetric-key method, now largely obsolete due to its vulnerability to brute-force attacks.
- **[[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]] ([[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]]):** The current gold standard for [[Symmetric Cryptography|symmetric encryption]], widely used across various industries due to its strength and efficiency.
- **[[External Notes/RSA]] ([[External Notes/RSA|Rivest–Shamir–Adleman]]):** A common [[asymmetric encryption]] [[algorithm]] used for secure data transmission.
- **[[Elliptic Curve Cryptography]] ([[Elliptic Curve Cryptography|ECC]]):** Provides stronger security with smaller key sizes, enhancing the performance of [[asymmetric encryption]].

## Advantages

- **Data Confidentiality:** Ensures that sensitive data cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.
- **Data Integrity:** Protects data from being altered during storage or transmission.
- **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of parties in communication.
- **Non-repudiation:** Prevents any party from denying the authenticity of their signature on a message or a document.

## Major Tools

- **OpenSSL:** A robust toolset for SSL and TLS protocols that includes an open-source library for implementing [[encryption]] services.
- **Microsoft BitLocker:** Provides drive [[encryption]] to protect data on Windows devices.
- **GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard):** A free implementation of the OpenPGP standard that allows encrypting and signing data and communications.
- **VeraCrypt:** An open-source disk [[encryption]] software used to create encrypted volumes or encrypt entire storage devices.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-57]],** "Recommendations for Key Management": Provides guidelines for managing cryptographic keys that underpin secure [[encryption]].
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]]):** Mandates the protection of personal data and privacy for individuals within the European Union. [[Encryption]] is recommended as a method to protect sensitive data.
- **[[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] ([[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)|HIPAA]]):** In the U.S., [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)|HIPAA]] suggests [[encryption]] as a safeguard for protecting ePHI (Electronic Protected Health Information) to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and security.

## Current Status

As technology advances, [[encryption]] tools continue to evolve, responding to new security challenges and the needs of digital security. Ongoing developments include enhancing cryptographic strength and the efficiency of [[encryption]] [[Algorithm|algorithms]] to defend against [[emerging threats]] such as [[quantum computing]].
