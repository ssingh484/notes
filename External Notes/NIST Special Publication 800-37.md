# NIST Special Publication 800-37

NIST Special Publication 800-37, "Guide for Applying the [[Risk Management]] Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach," is a foundational document developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It provides detailed guidance on implementing the [[Risk Management Framework]] ([[Risk Management Framework|RMF]]) to federal information systems. The publication aims to integrate security and [[risk management]] activities into the system development life cycle.

## How It Works

NIST SP 800-37 outlines a process that transitions from traditional compliance-based assessment and authorization activities to a risk-based approach that promotes continuous security and privacy. The guide details the following six-step process of the [[Risk Management Framework|RMF]]:

1. **Categorize Information System:** Define the system and categorize information processed, stored, and transmitted based on impact levels.
2. **Select Security Controls:** Select baseline security controls; apply tailoring guidance and supplement controls as needed based on a risk assessment.
3. **Implement Security Controls:** Implement the selected controls and document how the controls are employed within the system and environment of operation.
4. **Assess Security Controls:** Assess the security controls to determine if they are effective in their application.
5. **Authorize Information System:** Authorize system operation based upon a determination of the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the nation.
6. **Monitor Security Controls:** Continuously monitor the security controls in the information system to ensure they remain effective over time in light of evolving threats.

## Common Techniques

- **Risk Assessment:** Regular evaluations to identify vulnerabilities and threats, determine potential impacts, and propose necessary controls.
- **Security Control Tailoring:** Adjusting the baseline security controls to account for specific organizational requirements, environments of operation, and risk factors.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Using tools and procedures to continually assess the security state of information systems to support ongoing [[risk management]] decisions.

## Advantages

- **Comprehensive Framework:** Provides a detailed, structured process for managing security and privacy risk that is aligned with system development and life cycle processes.
- **Flexibility:** Offers a flexible approach that can be tailored to the complexity and scope of systems and the risk environment of organizations.
- **Enhanced Security Posture:** Promotes the development of secure, resilient, and trustworthy systems for federal agencies and associated contractors.

## Major Tools

- **eMASS (Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service):** Supports the implementation of the [[Risk Management Framework|RMF]] with tools for documentation, control implementation, and assessment.
- **Cybersecurity Assessment Tool (CSAT):** Software tool used for assessing compliance with [[NIST Special Publication 800-53|NIST SP 800-53]] security controls and managing system authorizations.
- **Tenable.sc (formerly SecurityCenter):** Provides a platform for continuous monitoring of vulnerabilities and compliance with security controls.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)|Federal Information Security Management Act]] ([[Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)|FISMA]]):** Mandates the implementation of the [[Risk Management Framework|RMF]] to promote the development of comprehensive [[risk management]] programs in federal agencies.
- **[[NIST Special Publication 800-53|NIST SP 800-53]]:** Provides a catalog of security controls that support the steps outlined in NIST SP 800-37.
