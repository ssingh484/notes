# PCI DSS

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. The standard was established by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), formed by major payment card brands such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.

## Key Features

- **Data Protection:** Requires the [[encryption]] of transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.
- **Access Control:** Mandates that access to system information and operations is restricted and controlled.
- **[[Network Security]]:** Involves the use of [[firewalls]], secure configurations, and intrusion detection/prevention systems to protect cardholder data.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Prescribes regular updates to anti-virus software and the development and maintenance of secure systems and applications.
- **Monitoring and Testing:** Demands regular testing of security systems and processes to ensure they defend against potential attacks.
- **Information Security Policy:** Requires the maintenance of a policy that addresses information security for employees and contractors.

## How It Works

PCI DSS applies to all entities involved in payment card processingâ€”including merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and service providers. Compliance is enforced by the major payment card brands and is required for any business that handles credit card transactions. The standard specifies 12 requirements for compliance, organized into six control objectives:

1. **Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems**
2. **Protect Cardholder Data**
3. **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program**
4. **Implement Strong Access Control Measures**
5. **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks**
6. **Maintain an Information Security Policy**

## Problem Addressed

PCI DSS addresses the risks associated with the theft and unauthorized use of payment card data. It provides a baseline of technical and operational requirements designed to protect cardholder data and mitigate data breaches.

## Implications

Non-compliance with PCI DSS can result in substantial fines from payment card brands, legal costs, and lost business due to decreased consumer trust. For compliant entities, PCI DSS helps in fostering trust with customers, enhancing reputational value, and avoiding financial penalties.

## Impact

Adhering to PCI DSS helps prevent security breaches and data theft. For businesses, this not only avoids financial penalties and loss of reputation but also contributes to a secure transaction environment for consumers, thereby enhancing customer confidence.

## Defense Mechanisms

PCI DSS encourages the adoption of comprehensive security measures such as strong [[encryption]], access control, and continuous monitoring to protect against the exploitation of vulnerabilities within payment systems.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Common challenges include maintaining compliance amidst evolving security threats, the complexity of implementing and managing the required controls, especially for small businesses, and the potential for internal threats or human error.

## Common Tools/Software

- **QualysGuard:** Provides automated cloud solutions to help businesses comply with PCI DSS.
- **Verizon Enterprise Solutions:** Offers services for managing compliance and securing payment systems.
- **Tenable Nessus:** Assists in vulnerability and compliance assessments relative to PCI DSS requirements.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity:** Although not specific to PCI DSS, this framework complements its standards by providing a broader approach to managing cybersecurity risk.

## Best Practices

- Regularly update software and systems to protect against known vulnerabilities.
- Conduct routine security training for all personnel involved in processing or handling credit card information.
- Perform regular internal and external audits to ensure continuous compliance with PCI DSS standards.

## Current Status

The standards are periodically updated by the PCI Security Standards Council to address new security challenges and technological changes in payment card security.
