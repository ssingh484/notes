# Introduction to Cryptography

[[Cryptography]] is the science of securing communications using codes and ciphers so that only the sender and intended recipient can understand the content. It involves techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties, known as adversaries.

## Key Features

- **[[Encryption]]:** Converts plain text into unintelligible text (ciphertext) and vice versa.
- **[[Hash Function|Hash Functions]]:** Converts data into a fixed-size string of bytes, typically used for creating [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]].
- **Key Management:** The process of handling cryptographic keys, including their generation, storage, [[Distribution Phase|distribution]], and destruction.

## How It Works

[[Cryptography]] uses mathematical algorithms to transform data into a format that is unreadable without a key. [[Encryption]] [[Algorithm|algorithms]] can be divided into two categories:

- **[[Symmetric Cryptography|Symmetric-key Cryptography]]:** The same key is used for both [[encryption]] and decryption. It's fast and suitable for large data volumes but requires secure key exchange.
- **[[Asymmetric Encryption|Asymmetric-key Cryptography]]:** Uses a pair of keys (public and private keys). The [[public key]] is used for [[encryption]] and the [[private key]] for decryption. It facilitates secure key distribution and [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]] but is slower than [[Symmetric Cryptography|symmetric-key cryptography]].

## Problem Addressed

[[Cryptography]] addresses the need for privacy, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in digital communications and data storage, protecting information from unauthorized access and manipulation.

## Implications

[[Cryptography]] is essential in various digital applications, from securing online transactions and communications to protecting sensitive data stored on digital devices and cloud environments.

## Impact

[[Cryptography]] enhances the security of digital systems and communications, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and integral. It is crucial for maintaining trust in digital infrastructures and is foundational to numerous cybersecurity measures.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **[[Digital Signature|Digital Signatures]]:** Ensure the authenticity and integrity of a message or document.
- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS):** Protocols that provide secure Internet communications.
- **[[Cryptographic Protocols]]:** Frameworks like IPsec and SSH that provide secure channels over potentially insecure networks.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Weak or outdated [[cryptographic algorithms]] can be broken, keys can be improperly managed or exposed, and cryptographic systems can be misconfigured, all of which can compromise security.

## Common Tools/Software

- **OpenSSL:** A toolkit for implementing SSL/TLS protocols and [[cryptographic algorithms]].
- **GnuPG:** Free software for securing communication and data with [[encryption]].
- **Microsoft Cryptographic API:** A library that provides services for [[encryption]] and decryption in Windows.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST Special Publications (e.g., [[NIST Special Publication 800-57]] and [[NIST Special Publication 800-63]]):** Provide guidelines on key management and digital authentication.
- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Includes requirements for managing information security risks, including those related to [[cryptography]].
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]]):** Implies the use of cryptographic techniques to protect personal data, aligning with its privacy by design principle.

## Best Practices

- Use strong, widely accepted cryptographic algorithms and large key sizes.
- Regularly update cryptographic systems to incorporate advances in security and to replace deprecated algorithms.
- Ensure secure management and storage of cryptographic keys.

## Current Status

[[Cryptography]] continues to evolve with advances in computing technology and mathematics, as well as new regulatory requirements. The rise of quantum computing has spurred research into quantum-resistant cryptographic methods to prepare for future challenges.
