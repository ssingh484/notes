# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Identity and Access Management (IAM) refers to the framework of policies and technologies that ensures the right individuals can access the appropriate resources at the right times for the right reasons. IAM systems provide tools for securely managing identities and access rights across a variety of systems.

## Subtopics

![[01 Cybersecurity Mastery#4. ** Identity and Access Management (IAM)**]]

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users before granting access to systems.
- **Authorization Management**: Controls what resources a user can access and what actions they can perform within a system.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple systems without re-authenticating.
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhances security by requiring two or more verification factors to access resources.
- **User Lifecycle Management**: Manages the entire lifecycle of user identities from initial creation to final deletion.

## Problem Addressed

IAM addresses the challenges related to managing digital identities and ensuring that users have appropriate access to technology resources. It helps prevent unauthorized access, thereby reducing the risk of internal and external security breaches.

## Implications

Effective IAM systems are crucial for maintaining security compliance, protecting sensitive data, and enhancing operational efficiencies by streamlining user access processes. They play a key role in enforcing security policies across an organization's networks and applications.

## Impact

- **Direct Effects**: Streamlines user access to resources, enhancing productivity while maintaining security.
- **Long-Term Influence**: Improves regulatory compliance and data security, which are critical for sustaining business operations and trust.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Grants access based on the role within an organization rather than the individual identity.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Uses policies that combine attributes (user, resource, environment) to make access decisions.
- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**: Controls and monitors administrative access and privileges for critical systems.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Insider Threats**: IAM systems can be compromised by insiders who already have access to the systems.
- **Configuration Errors**: Misconfigured IAM tools can lead to excessive permissions or unauthorized access.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Okta**: Provides identity management with Single Sign-On, Multi-factor Authentication, Lifecycle Management, and more.
- **Microsoft Azure Active Directory**: Offers identity and access management for the cloud, including SSO, MFA, and conditional access policies.
- **OneLogin**: Delivers IAM solutions across cloud and on-premise applications with a focus on ease of use and security.

## Current Status

As businesses continue to expand their digital landscapes, the complexity of managing access to an ever-growing number of systems becomes more challenging. IAM solutions are evolving with advancements in technology, including the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance decision-making and anomaly detection.
