# Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) refers to [[cryptographic algorithms]] specifically designed to be secure against potential threats posed by [[Quantum Computing|quantum computers]]. While traditional cryptographic systems, like [[External Notes/RSA]] and [[Elliptic Curve Cryptography|ECC]], rely on the difficulty of problems such as integer factorization or [[Elliptic Curve Cryptography|elliptic curve]] logarithms, PQC aims to base security on mathematical problems believed to be resistant to quantum attack.

## Key Features

- **[[Quantum-Resistant]]**: Unlike some classical [[cryptographic algorithms]], the security of PQC methods isn't compromised by the capabilities of [[Quantum Computing|quantum computers]].
- **Variety of Approaches**: PQC encompasses various cryptographic systems including:
    - [[Lattice-based cryptography]]
    - [[Code-based cryptography]]
    - [[Multivariate polynomial cryptography]]
    - [[Hash-based cryptography]]
    - [[Isogeny-based cryptography]]
    - [[Zero Knowledge Proof-based cryptography]]
- **NIST Standardization**: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been working on standardizing post-quantum [[cryptographic algorithms]] to establish secure replacements for current public-key [[Algorithm|algorithms]].
