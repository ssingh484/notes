# Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA)

The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) is a United States federal law enacted in 2015 to improve cybersecurity in the U.S. through enhanced sharing of information about cybersecurity threats. CISA is designed to help both the private sector and the government share critical cybersecurity information without legal barriers and in real time, facilitating a collaborative approach to defend against cyber threats.

## Key Features

- **Liability Protection:** Provides legal liability protection for companies that share threat information, aiming to encourage more open and frequent sharing of cybersecurity threat data.
- **Privacy Protections:** Includes measures to protect individuals' privacy and personally identifiable information (PII) when cybersecurity threat data is shared.
- **Real-time Sharing:** Establishes mechanisms for sharing information about cyber threats in real time or near real time between private sector entities and the federal government.
- **Public-Private Collaboration:** Encourages collaboration between the private sector and government agencies to enhance the nation’s cybersecurity posture.

## Problem Addressed

CISA addresses the need for timely and efficient sharing of cybersecurity threat information to prevent and respond to cyber attacks more effectively. Prior to CISA, legal uncertainties and potential liability risks discouraged organizations from sharing information about cyber threats.

## Implications

By facilitating enhanced information sharing, CISA helps organizations gain access to vital security intelligence that could prevent potential cyber incidents. This act is crucial for national security, economic stability, and the protection of private enterprises from cyber threats.

## Impact

The implementation of CISA has led to increased cooperation and information sharing between the private sector and government, resulting in faster responses to cyber threats and reduced impacts of cyber attacks across different sectors.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Cyber Threat Indicators:** Organizations share indicators of cyber threats, such as malicious IP addresses or methods of cyber attack.
- **Automated Sharing:** The use of automated systems for the real-time exchange of cyber threat information.
- **Analysis and Dissemination:** Shared information is analyzed and disseminated to relevant stakeholders to aid in threat response and mitigation.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

While CISA enhances information sharing, it also raises concerns about overreach and privacy implications if not properly managed, especially regarding the handling and protection of personal information.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS):** DHS’s system that enables the sharing of cyber threat indicators between the government and the private sector at machine speed.
- **[[Threat Intelligence Platforms]]:** Tools that support the aggregation, correlation, and analysis of threat data shared under CISA.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[NIST Cybersecurity Framework]]:** Provides a policy framework for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity, complementary to CISA’s information sharing goals.
- **[[Homeland Security Act of 2002]]:** Establishes the framework for governmental cybersecurity operations, within which CISA operates.

## Best Practices

- **Ensure Data Privacy:** Implement strict controls to anonymize personally identifiable information before sharing cyber threat information.
- **Verify and Validate Information:** Ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information being shared to maintain the usefulness and credibility of the data.
- **Regular Participation:** Actively engage in sharing and receiving information to stay informed about the latest threats and defenses.

## Current Status

CISA continues to evolve as new cybersecurity challenges emerge. The framework and practices under CISA are periodically reviewed and updated to enhance collaborative efforts and protect against the latest cyber threats.
