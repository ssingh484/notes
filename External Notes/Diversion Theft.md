# Diversion Theft

Diversion theft is a [[Social Engineering Techniques|social engineering]] tactic where attackers deceive a target into redirecting a delivery or transfer of valuable items or information to a location controlled by the attacker. This technique exploits trust and operational processes to intercept and steal assets.

## Key Features

- **Redirection:** Involves convincing the target to redirect a delivery or transfer.
- **Impersonation:** Attackers often pose as trusted entities or personnel.
- **Deception:** Uses convincing scenarios to persuade the target to comply.
- **Targeted:** Often focuses on valuable items or sensitive information.

## Problem Addressed

Diversion theft aims to bypass security measures by exploiting the trust and routine processes involved in deliveries and transfers. It can lead to significant financial losses and breaches of sensitive information.

## Implications

- **Asset Loss:** Results in the theft of valuable items or sensitive information.
- **Operational Disruption:** Can disrupt normal business operations and delivery processes.
- **Security Breach:** Compromises the integrity of secure delivery and transfer methods.
- **Financial Fraud:** Can result in substantial financial losses.

## Impact

- **Loss of Trust:** Erodes trust in delivery and transfer processes.
- **Financial Loss:** Can cause significant financial losses due to stolen assets.
- **Reputation Damage:** Organizations may suffer reputational damage if diversion theft leads to publicized security failures.
- **Regulatory Consequences:** Potential legal and regulatory repercussions for failing to protect against such attacks.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Employee Training:** Regularly educate employees about diversion theft tactics and how to recognize and respond to them.
- **Verification Protocols:** Implement strict verification processes for any changes to delivery or transfer instructions.
- **Secure Communication:** Use secure communication channels to confirm any changes to delivery or transfer details.
- **Incident Reporting:** Encourage a culture of reporting suspicious requests or changes in delivery instructions.
- **Awareness Programs:** Develop ongoing security awareness programs to keep diversion theft threats top of mind.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

- **Trust in Routine Processes:** Relies on the trust and routine nature of delivery and transfer processes.
- **Lack of Awareness:** Takes advantage of targets who are unaware of diversion theft tactics.
- **Inadequate Verification:** Exploits weak or non-existent verification processes.
- **Operational Vulnerabilities:** Uses vulnerabilities in operational procedures to redirect deliveries or transfers.

## Common Tools/Techniques

- **[[Phishing]] Emails:** Sending emails that appear to come from legitimate sources requesting changes to delivery details.
- **Phone Calls:** Making phone calls posing as delivery personnel or company representatives to redirect deliveries.
- **Fake Websites:** Creating fake websites or portals to capture delivery details and request changes.

## Best Practices

- **Continuous Education:** Conduct regular training sessions to keep employees aware of the risks and signs of diversion theft.
- **Verification Processes:** Implement strict protocols for verifying any changes to delivery or transfer instructions.
- **Secure Communication:** Use secure and verified communication channels to confirm any changes.
- **Clear Policies:** Establish and communicate clear policies for handling requests for changes to delivery or transfer details.
- **Regular Audits:** Perform regular audits of delivery and transfer processes and security measures.
- **Incident Reporting:** Encourage a culture of reporting any suspicious requests or changes in delivery instructions.
