# NIST Special Publication 800-56C

NIST Special Publication 800-56C, titled "Recommendation for Key-Derivation Methods in Key-Establishment Schemes," provides guidelines for deriving cryptographic keys from shared secret information. It is part of the NIST recommendations focused on ensuring secure and efficient key management practices in [[cryptographic protocols]].

## Key Features

- **Key Derivation Functions (KDFs):** Specifies the use of functions to derive one or more secret keys from a shared secret key material, which is typically established through a key agreement protocol.
- **Security Properties:** Ensures that the derived keys possess the necessary cryptographic strength for their intended purposes.
- **Compatibility:** Offers guidelines that are compatible with other key establishment and management standards, enhancing interoperability across different systems and technologies.

## Problem Addressed

NIST SP 800-56C addresses the need for securely generating additional cryptographic keys from a limited amount of initial key material. This publication ensures that derived keys are secure enough for their intended use, preventing potential security vulnerabilities in cryptographic processes.

## Implications

Adherence to these guidelines is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of cryptographic key management processes, particularly in environments where multiple keys are needed from a single initial key exchange. This can include various applications like securing network communications, data [[encryption]], and [[Digital Signature|digital signatures]].

## Impact

Implementing the key derivation methods recommended by SP 800-56C enhances the overall security of cryptographic systems by ensuring that derived keys do not compromise the security of the original key material or the [[encryption]] system as a whole.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Robust Key Derivation Algorithms:** Provides a secure method of expanding a limited amount of initial key material into multiple keys.
- **Entropy Preservation:** Ensures that the randomness (entropy) from the original key material is maintained in the derived keys, preventing reductions in key strength.
- **Clear Parameters Selection:** Offers guidance on selecting appropriate parameters for key derivation to maximize security.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

The effectiveness of key derivation methods can be compromised by poor implementation, weak derivation parameters, or inadequate management of the initial key material. Ensuring compliance with NIST SP 800-56C is crucial to mitigate these risks.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Cryptographic Libraries:** Such as OpenSSL and Crypto++, which implement secure key derivation functions according to NIST standards.
- **Security Compliance and Testing Tools:** Tools that help verify the compliance of cryptographic implementations with NIST SP 800-56C recommendations.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS):** Requires the use of approved cryptographic methods, including key derivation, in government communications and information systems.
- **[[NIST Cybersecurity Framework]]:** Aligns with SP 800-56C by recommending the use of secure methods for key management and establishment in securing critical infrastructure.

## Best Practices

- **Use Approved KDFs:** Only utilize key derivation functions that are approved and recommended by NIST to ensure security.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit cryptographic systems to ensure ongoing compliance with NIST recommendations and detect potential vulnerabilities.
- **Educate Development Teams:** Ensure that teams responsible for implementing cryptographic systems are well-versed in the latest NIST publications and best practices.

## Current Status

NIST regularly updates its publications to reflect advancements in cryptographic research and changes in technology. SP 800-56C is reviewed and revised to ensure that it continues to provide relevant and secure key derivation guidelines.
