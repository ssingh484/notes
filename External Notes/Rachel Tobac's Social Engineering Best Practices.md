### Major Lessons Learned from Rachel Tobac on Social Engineering

## General Principles
1. **Thorough Reconnaissance is Crucial:**
   - Spend ample time (up to a month) gathering detailed information about the target.
   - Understand the company structure, key personnel, and internal processes.

2. **Crafting Convincing Stories:**
   - Develop believable scenarios and backstories to gain sympathy and cooperation.
   - Use emotional appeals and urgency to prompt immediate action from targets.

3. **Exploiting Human Psychology:**
   - Leverage trust, authority, and fear to manipulate targets.
   - Build rapport through personalized interactions.

## Specific Techniques

##### New Employee Ruse
4. **Posing as a New Employee:**
   - Posing as a new employee allows for asking numerous questions without raising suspicion.
   - This tactic is effective for gathering sensitive information within a corporate environment.

##### Chat-Based Approach
5. **Initial Contact via Chat:**
   - Use chat services to pose as a customer needing urgent assistance.
   - Aim to change the registered email or phone number to gain administrative access.

##### Phone Call-Based Attack
6. **Phone Call-Based Attack Benefits:**
   - Less of a digital paper trail.
   - Ability to build rapport through voice, making it easier to sound trustworthy and persuasive.

7. **Using [[Caller ID Spoofing]]:**
   - Caller ID spoofing can be easily and cheaply done using apps.
   - Effective for impersonating customers during [[Social Engineering Techniques|social engineering]] attacks.

8. **Creating Emotional Appeals:**
   - Use scripts that elicit empathy and urgency, e.g., posing as a stressed traveler needing access to funds.

9. **Limitations of Phone Spoofing:**
   - Cannot receive text messages.
   - If the bank calls back, it won’t reach the attacker’s phone.
   - Spoofing only mimics the caller ID without giving actual access to the number.

##### Overcoming Verification Challenges
10. **Providing Fake Documentation:**
    - Use photoshopped documents for additional verification when required.
    - Recognize that institutions often do not thoroughly verify details beyond matching names and addresses.

##### Investigating Insider Threats and Leaks
11. **Posing as a Journalist:**
    - Create a fake journalist identity to gather information about sensitive company activities.
    - Use direct messaging, emailing, and texting to contact potential insiders.

12. **Exploiting LinkedIn:**
    - Use LinkedIn to identify key personnel with relevant skills and roles.
    - Target individuals likely to have access to sensitive information.

13. **Exploiting the Hiring Process:**
    - Apply for jobs to exploit the hiring process for gathering information about company activities and technologies.
    - Create convincing fake profiles with resumes, LinkedIn, and other social media accounts.
    - Ask targeted questions during interviews to extract sensitive information.

##### Using AI to Trick Individuals
14. **Voice Cloning and Spoofing:**
    - Use voice cloning tools to mimic a target’s coworker’s voice.
    - Create plausible scenarios requiring the target’s cooperation.

15. **Creating Plausible Scenarios:**
    - Develop scripts that are direct and to the point to minimize follow-up questions.
    - Position the target to be available when making the spoofed call.

#### Defensive Measures
16. **Identify Edge Cases:**
    - Understand scenarios that could be exploited.
    - Prepare responses for unusual or suspicious requests.

17. **Implement Callbacks:**
    - Verify the caller’s identity through a callback system to thwart spoofing.

18. **Email Verification and One-Time Passwords:**

19. **Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    - Replace knowledge-based authentication with more secure methods.

20. **Service Codes, PINs, and Verbal Passcodes:**

21. **Involve Management:**
    - Loop in higher-level personnel for internal support tickets and sensitive requests.

22. **Educate Employees:**
    - Train employees to recognize [[Social Engineering Techniques|social engineering]] tactics.
    - Promote a culture of skepticism and verification for unexpected requests.

23. **Regularly Update Security Protocols:**
    - Stay informed about the latest [[Social Engineering Techniques|social engineering]] techniques.
    - Continuously improve and adapt security measures to address new threats.
