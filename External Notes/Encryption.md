# Encryption

Encryption is a security technique that encodes data so that only authorized parties can access it. This process converts plain text into a non-readable form called ciphertext, using a cryptographic key. Decryption is the reverse process, which transforms ciphertext back to plain text, enabling authorized users to access the original information.

## Key Features

- **[[Symmetric Encryption]]:** Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Examples include [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|AES]] ([[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]]) and [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] ([[Data Encryption Standard]]).
- **[[Asymmetric Encryption]]:** Uses a pair of keys, one for encryption ([[public key]]) and another for decryption ([[private key]]). Commonly used protocols include [[External Notes/RSA]] and [[Elliptic Curve Cryptography|ECC]] ([[Elliptic Curve Cryptography]]).
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Ensures that data is encrypted at the source and decrypted only by the intended recipient, preventing intermediaries from accessing the plaintext data.
- **Hash Functions:** Used to create a unique digital fingerprint of data, which is crucial for verifying integrity without needing to encrypt and decrypt the entire dataset.

## Problem Addressed

Encryption addresses the need for confidentiality and integrity in data storage and transmission, protecting against unauthorized access and data breaches. It is vital for securing sensitive information such as financial details, personal data, and confidential communications.

## Implications

The widespread use of encryption is critical for privacy, security, and compliance in digital communications and transactions. It plays a key role in trust-building and the safe exchange of information across insecure networks, like the internet.

## Impact

Encryption enhances the security of digital systems and networks by ensuring that data remains confidential and integral. It protects against cyber threats, including eavesdropping, data theft, and tampering, thus maintaining the privacy and security of user data across various platforms.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Digital Signatures:** Utilize asymmetric encryption to validate the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents.
- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS):** Protocols that provide communications security over a computer network.
- **Encrypted Storage:** Protects data at rest by encrypting files on a device or server, ensuring data is inaccessible without proper authorization.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

Weak encryption algorithms or poorly managed cryptographic keys can lead to vulnerabilities. Additionally, encryption can't protect against security breaches that exploit software flaws or social engineering attacks.

## Common Tools/Software

- **OpenSSL:** A robust, open-source library for SSL and TLS protocols.
- **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy):** Encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication.
- **Microsoft BitLocker:** An encryption service included with Windows, designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **NIST Special Publication 800-57, "Recommendations for Key Management"**: Guidelines for cryptographic key management, which is essential for effective encryption.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Requires protection of personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. The regulation often implies the use of encryption as a method to protect data.
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: In the United States, mandates the protection of sensitive patient data, where encryption is recommended as a safeguard for transmitting and storing electronic protected health information (ePHI).

## Best Practices

- Use strong and updated encryption algorithms recommended by security experts.
- Implement robust key management and storage practices to prevent unauthorized access to cryptographic keys.
- Regularly update and patch encryption software to mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Current Status

Encryption technology is continuously evolving to meet new security challenges and compliance requirements. Ongoing research into quantum cryptography and post-quantum cryptography aims to prepare for future threats posed by quantum computing.
