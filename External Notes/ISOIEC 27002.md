# ISO/IEC 27002

ISO/IEC 27002 is an international standard titled "Information technology — Security techniques — Code of practice for information security controls." It provides guidelines for organizational information security standards and information security management practices including the selection, implementation, and management of controls taking into consideration the organization’s information security risk environments.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Security Controls:** Offers best practices on a wide range of information security management topics including risk management, human resource security, asset management, access control, [[cryptography]], physical security, operations security, and compliance.
- **Flexibility:** Designed to be adapted to the specific needs of any organization, regardless of its size, type, or nature.
- **Harmonization:** Works in harmony with other standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family, especially [[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]], which provides specifications for an information security management system (ISMS).

## Problem Addressed

ISO/IEC 27002 addresses the need for establishing and maintaining adequate and proportionate security controls tailored to the specific risks the organization faces. The standard helps organizations protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

## Implications

Adopting ISO/IEC 27002 can significantly enhance an organization's security posture by providing a comprehensive framework for identifying, evaluating, and managing information security risks. This standard is instrumental in achieving compliance with regulatory requirements and establishing trust with clients and partners regarding security practices.

## Impact

Implementing ISO/IEC 27002 helps organizations:

- Protect assets and data.
- Increase resilience to cyber attacks.
- Ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
- Enhance the organization's reputation by demonstrating commitment to information security.

## Defense Mechanisms

- **Risk Assessment and Treatment:** Provides a systematic approach to managing information security risks.
- **Organizational Controls:** Offers guidelines on structure and responsibilities, mobile devices, and teleworking.
- **Human Resource Security:** Ensures that employees, contractors, and third-party users understand their responsibilities and are suitable for the roles they are considered for.

## Exploitable Mechanisms/Weaknesses

While ISO/IEC 27002 provides extensive guidelines, the actual security posture depends heavily on the organization's faithful implementation and ongoing management of the prescribed controls. Inadequate implementation or lack of regular updates and reviews can leave organizations vulnerable.

## Common Tools/Software

- **Compliance Management Tools:** Software like Microsoft Compliance Manager and OneTrust, which help track and manage compliance with ISO/IEC 27002.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** Tools such as Splunk and LogRhythm that support monitoring and reporting on security controls.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** Provides the requirements for an ISMS and is designed to be supported by ISO/IEC 27002 guidelines.
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] Compliance:** ISO/IEC 27002 can help address security measures required under [[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] by providing a systematic framework for data protection and breach prevention.
- **[[PCI DSS]]:** For organizations that handle cardholder data, aligning with ISO/IEC 27002 can support compliance with the [[PCI DSS|Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] ([[PCI DSS]]).
