# ISO/IEC 27043

ISO/IEC 27043, "Information technology — Security techniques — Incident investigation principles and processes," is an international standard that provides guidelines for conducting systematic incident investigations related to information security breaches. This standard is part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, which are designed to help organizations manage the security of assets such as financial information, intellectual property, employee details, and information entrusted by third parties.

## Key Features

- **Structured Framework:** Provides a structured framework for responding to, investigating, and managing the aftermath of security incidents.
- **Interoperability:** Designed to be compatible with other information security management standards and practices, ensuring a comprehensive approach to incident management.
- **Scalability:** Applicable to organizations of all sizes and types, adaptable to the complexity and specific requirements of different incidents.

## How It Works

The standard outlines a process that includes:

1. **Preparation:** Establishing policies, procedures, tools, and responsibilities necessary to conduct an effective investigation.
2. **Detection and Reporting:** Identifying and documenting incidents as they occur.
3. **Assessment and Decision:** Assessing the incidents to determine their nature and scope and deciding on the appropriate response.
4. **Investigation:** Systematically investigating the incident to identify the cause and method of attack.
5. **Closure:** Concluding the investigation with a comprehensive report and implementing lessons learned.

## Common Techniques

- **Digital Forensics:** Utilizing digital forensic techniques to gather and preserve evidence while maintaining its integrity.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the underlying cause of the incident to prevent future occurrences.
- **Chain of Custody Management:** Ensuring that evidence is handled in a manner that preserves its admissibility in legal proceedings.

## Advantages

- **Improved Incident Response:** Helps organizations prepare for and respond to information security incidents effectively.
- **Enhanced Resilience:** Aids in developing organizational resilience by improving the ability to detect, investigate, and recover from security incidents.
- **Compliance and Standardization:** Supports compliance with international security standards and provides a standardized approach to incident investigation.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[ISOIEC 27001|ISO/IEC 27001]]:** This standard on information security management systems provides the overarching management framework within which ISO/IEC 27043 operates.
- **ISO/IEC 27035:** Lays out security incident management principles, specifically focusing on how to manage and respond to incidents effectively.
- **NIST SP 800-61:** "Computer Security Incident Handling Guide," which complements ISO/IEC 27043 by providing additional guidelines and best practices for incident management.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Training:** Conduct regular training and simulations for incident response teams to enhance their skills and readiness.
- **Integrated Security Measures:** Integrate incident investigation processes with the overall risk management and security operations of the organization.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Use findings from past investigations to continuously improve security policies and practices.

## Current Status

ISO/IEC 27043 continues to evolve to address new challenges in cybersecurity incident investigation as technologies and threat landscapes change. Organizations worldwide adopt and integrate this standard into their security frameworks to enhance their ability to respond to and recover from security incidents.
