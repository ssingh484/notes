# Surveillance and Counter-Surveillance

[[Surveillance]] refers to the monitoring of behavior, activities, or information for the purpose of gathering intelligence, managing or protecting people. It often involves observing individuals or groups by governments or other entities, primarily through digital means. [[Counter-surveillance]] is the practice of avoiding or diminishing surveillance to protect privacy or ensure that sensitive information remains confidential.

## How It Works

### Surveillance

- **Digital Monitoring:** Involves the use of electronic devices to monitor and record internet activity, phone calls, and use of digital applications.
- **Data Interception and Analysis:** Capturing and analyzing data transferred over networks, including emails, social media traffic, and website visits.
- **Use of Cameras and Recording Devices:** Implementing CCTV systems in public or targeted spaces to record video and audio activities.

### Counter-Surveillance

- **Signal Jammers:** Devices used to block or interfere with electronic signals to prevent surveillance devices from functioning.
- **[[Encryption]]:** Using cryptographic methods to secure communications and data from unauthorized interception and access.
- **Anonymous Browsing Tools:** Tools like [[Virtual Private Networks|VPNs]] ([[Virtual Private Networks]]) and [[Tor Network|Tor]] that hide an individual's IP address and encrypt web traffic.

## Common Techniques

### Surveillance Techniques

- **CCTV Surveillance:** Use of closed-circuit television cameras to monitor public and private spaces.
- **Computer and Network Surveillance:** Includes keyloggers, browser history tracking, and use of spyware.
- **Phone Surveillance:** Use of call intercepts, SMS interception, and access to phone metadata.

### Counter-Surveillance Techniques

- **Using Burner Phones:** Disposable phones that can be used temporarily and then discarded.
- **Anti-Surveillance Clothing:** Clothing designed to thwart surveillance, such as masks or materials that obscure facial recognition technology.
- **Secure Communication Apps:** Applications that provide end-to-end [[encryption]] for messages and calls.

## Advantages

### Surveillance

- **Enhanced Security:** Helps in preventing crimes and quickly reacting to threatening situations.
- **Intelligence Gathering:** Useful for gathering useful information for law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
- **Monitoring and Compliance:** Ensures compliance with laws and regulations in controlled environments.

### Counter-Surveillance

- **Privacy Protection:** Helps individuals and organizations maintain privacy and protect sensitive information.
- **Security Enhancement:** Protects against espionage, stalking, and unauthorized data collection.
- **Freedom of Expression:** Allows activists or dissenters to communicate and organize without fear of reprisal.

## Related Cybersecurity Policies

- **[[Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)|Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] ([[Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)|ECPA]]):** U.S. federal statute that prohibits unauthorized interception of electronic communications and sets forth requirements for lawful interception.
- **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|GDPR]] ([[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]]):** Includes provisions to protect personal data from unauthorized surveillance and processing.
- **[[USA PATRIOT Act]]:** Contains provisions that expand the ability of law enforcement to conduct surveillance for national security purposes.

## Current Status

Surveillance technology continues to advance, integrating more sophisticated forms of data collection and analysis, such as facial recognition and big data analytics. Counter-surveillance also evolves as new tools and techniques develop to protect privacy and counteract new surveillance measures.
