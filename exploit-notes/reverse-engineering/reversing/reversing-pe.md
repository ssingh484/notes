## PE Headers

There are many tools to analyze PE headers, such as `wxHexEditor`, `pe-tree`.  
[pe-tree](https://github.com/blackberry/pe_tree) is a tool that views PE files in a tree-view. It will take about a few minutes to open.

```sh
pe-tree ./executable
```

|Structure|Description|
|---|---|
|IMAGE_DOS_HEADER|It consists of the first 64 bytes of the PE file. The first two bytes (”4D 5A”) means the “MZ” characters which are an identity of the Portable Executable format.|
|DOS_STUB|It is a small piece of code that only runs if the PE file is incompatible with the system it is being run on. At such time the message “!This program cannot be run in DOS mode" will be displayed.|
|IMAGE_NT_HEADERS|It contains most of the vital information related to the PE file. The starting address of the IMAGE_NT_HEADERS is found in `e_lfanew` from the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER. It contains `NT_HEADERS`, `IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER`, `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTION`|

## Identify Packers of Packed Executable

[pecheck](https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/pecheck.py) is a command-line tool which analyze PE files.

```sh

```

When results appears, check the section name in the PE Section.
