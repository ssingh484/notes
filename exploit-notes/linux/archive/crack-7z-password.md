## Crack

```bash
7z2john example.7z > hash.txt
# or
/usr/share/john/7z2john.pl example.7z > hash.txt

john --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash.txt
```

If we got the error “`Can't locate Compress/Raw/Lzma.pm in @INC`...”, we need to install `libcompress-raw-lzma-perl` package so try:

```bash
sudo apt install libcompress-raw-lzma-perl
```
