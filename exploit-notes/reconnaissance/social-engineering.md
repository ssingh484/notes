## Techniques

### Phishing

Attackers may impersonate a legitimate company or website and steal account information by sending the victim an email with a link to a malicious site.

### Vishing (Voice Phishing)

Attackers may ask for passwords directly from victims over the phone.

### Smishing (SMS Phishing)

Attackers may use SMS to contact victims, pretending to be from a legitimate company, and redirecting them to a malicious site or installing an app.

### Shoulder Surfing

Attackers may peer into the computer or smartphone screen from behind the victim's back and steal passwords.

### Baiting

Attackers may persuade a victim to plug a malicious USB device into the victim's computer in order to steal personal information or corrupt the system.

### Pretexting

Attackers may contact victims through social media and trick them into asking for their passwords.

### Scareware

Attackers may unduly intimidate the victim into asking for information such as passwords to access the victim's data.
