## Fix Error “Failed to connect to x.x.x.x:443”

If we try to HTTP access rather than HTTPS, This error occurs because the Burp’s embedded browser uses secure connections automatically by default.

If we got the error, we may be able to solve the problem by the following methods:

1. In the embedded browser, open Settings by clicking on three dots menu icon.
2. Once Settings screen opens, go to “Privacy and security” → “Security”.
3. In “Advanced” section, uncheck “Always use secure connections” then close the Settings.
4. Enter the desired URL including “http://”.  **If all goes well, we may be able to access it.**
