## Enumeration

### Interesting Information

Run the following commands in WSL.

```bash
# Configuration
cat /etc/wsl.conf

# IP address of host machine
ip route | grep default

# IP address of WSL itself
ip a
# or
hostname -I
```

<br />

## Escape WSL to Windows Host Machine

If weâ€™are currently on WSL machine, we can access to the host Windows machine as below.

```bash
cd /mnt/c/
```

If **`/mnt/c/`** is empty, we need to mount the folder by running the following command.

```bash
cd /

# -t: Limit the set of filesystem types
# drvfs: A plugin for WSL
# C: : Specify the Windows root
mount -t drvfs C: /mnt/c
```
