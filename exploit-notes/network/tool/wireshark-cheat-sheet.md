## Start

```bash

<br />

## Settings

### Datetime Format When Packets Sent

Select “View → Time Display Format → Date and Time of Day”.

<br />

## Filters

Enter the following text in a filtering form.

### Datetime

```sh
frame.time >= "Jan 2, 2023 08:00:00" && frame.time <= "Jan 5, 2023 08:00:00"
```

### DNS

```sh
dns
udp.port == 53

# Record type
dns.qry.type == 1   # A record

dns.qry.type == 6   # SOA record
dns.qry.type == 15  # MX record
dns.qry.type == 16  # TXT record
dns.qry.type == 28  # AAAA record
dns.qry.type == 252 # AXFR

# Query name
dns.qry.name matches "example.com"

# Reponse
dns.flags.response == 0 # No response
```

### FTP

```sh
ftp
ftp-data
```

### HTTP & HTTPS

```sh
# HTTP
http
tcp.port == 80

# HTTPS
ssl
tcp.port == 443

tcp.port == 80 || tcp.port == 443

# Methods
http.request.method == GET
http.request.method == POST

# Domains
http.host matches "example.com"
http.host == "example.com"
```

### ICMP

```sh
icmp
```

### IP Address

```sh
ip.addr == 10.0.0.1
ip.addr != 10.0.0.2
ip.addr == 10.0.0.1 && ip.addr == 10.0.0.2
ip.src == 10.0.0.1
ip.dst == 10.0.0.2
ip.src == 10.0.0.1 && ip.dst != 10.0.0.0/24
```

### Kerberos (KRB4, KRB5)

```sh
kerberos
krb4
```

### SMB

```sh
smb
smb2
```

### SMTP

```sh
smtp
smtp.req.parameter contains "FROM"
```

### SSH

```sh
ssh
tcp.port == 22
```

<br />

## Detailed Information

1. Right click on the row item.
2. Select **Follow -> TCP Stream**. Another window opens.
3. Find information by clicking the arrow on the right of **"Stream *"**.

<br />

## More Information

- **Analyze -> Expert Information**

    Read the expert information.

- **Statistics -> Capture File Properties**

    Read the capture file comments.
    
- **Statistics → Conversations**
    
    List IP conversations. We can find IP addresses involved in the traffic.

- **Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy**
    
    Show usage of ports and services.

- **View -> Name Resolution**

    Resolve IP addresses.

<br />

## Data Exfiltration via DNS

1. Enter **"dns"** in filter form
2. If you found a domain such as follow, you may be able to retrieve threats.

    ```txt
    93616e64792043...2038343931.vulnerable.com
    ```

3. For example, decode "936...".

<br />

## Data Exfiltration via HTTP

1. Open **File -> Export Objects -> HTTP...** .
2. Click **"Save all"**.
3. Analyze steganographic files using tools like steghide.

<br />

## WiFi Handshakes

When importing pcap file, then if we found the capture file is about WiFi handshakes, we can crack the WiFi password using this file.

```bash
aircrack-ng example.pcap -w wordlist.txt
```

<br />

## Decrypting SSL/TLS Traffic

To retrieve data from TLS communications, we need to import the certificates (private key) into the WireShark at first. To find the certificates, the following commands may be useful in the server:

```bash
find / -name "*.key" 2>/dev/null
find /etc/apache2/ -name "*.key" 2>/dev/null
find /etc/nginx/ -name "*.key" 2>/dev/null
```

After getting the private key (e.g. `ssl_private.key`), we can import it in the WireShark as below:

1. In WireShark, go to the `Edit` → `Preferences` → `Protocols` → `TLS`.
2. Click the `RSA key list Edit...` and fill each field (Ip address, Port, Protocol). The Protocol field value must be `tcp`. Then specify our found private key in the Key File. Click OK.
3. Fill `TLS debug fild` with arbitrary file name. Click OK.

Now we can observe TLS communication as `HTTP`.

<br />

## Decrypt Kerberos Cipher Data

Seeing packet details for the Kerberos packet, we may see the encrypted data and the CNAME string as such below:

```bash
Kerberos:
  ...
  etype: eTYPE-AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 (18)
  cipher: abcdef01234...
  ...
  cname
    cname-string:
      CNameString: example
  realm: EXAMPLE.LOCAL
```

We may be able to decrypt the `cipher` value by cracking it.  

Copy the `cipher` value (e.g. `abcdef01234…`) and concatenate with the `krb` format (e.g. `$krb...`) as below.

The format is something like:

```bash
$krb5pa$[etype_number]$[cname]$[realm]$[cipher]
```

So make the formatted string and crack the hash using hashcat:

```sh
# Kerberos 5, etype 17, Pre-Auth
echo -n '$krb5pa$17$example$EXAMPLE.LOCAL$abcdef01234..' > hash.txt
hashcat -m 19800 hash.txt wordlist.txt

# Kerberos 5, etype 18, Pre-Auth
echo -n '$krb5pa$18$example$EXAMPLE.LOCAL$abcdef01234...' > hash.txt
hashcat -m 19900 hash.txt wordlist.txt
```

<br />

## Crack WiFi Password

In Wireshark, go to `File` → `Save As...` and save the traffic as `.pcap` file. Then check the target network using `aircrack-ng` as below:

```bash
aircrack-ng example.pcap
```

If the network found, crack the password:

```bash
aircrack-ng example.pcap -w wordlist.txt
```

After cracking, we can set it to the WireShark preference.

1. In WireShark, go to `Edit` → `Preferences` → `Protocols` → `IEEE 802.11`.  And click on the `Edit` of `Decryption Keys`.
2. Select `wpa-pwd` for the `Key type` and fill the password for the `Key`.
